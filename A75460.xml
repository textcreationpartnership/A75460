            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, if thou doſt live under the Croſſe, and art ſenſible of theſe ſad times, or if Gods viſitation be upon thee, which makes thee to ſigh and groan under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and preſſure of thy ſorrowes, ſo that thy ſoul deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth comfort, and thy ſpirits want ſpirituall refreſhing and heavenly conſolation: then I have written this Treatiſe for thee, which I preſent to thy view, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou ſhalt finde the true way how to demean thy ſelf under Gods viſitation, how to bear thy croſſe with a contented patience, how to make the burden of thy ſorrowes more eaſie, or how to be delivered out of them, if God ſeeth it to be moſt for his glory, and beſt for thy good; alſo how to refreſh thy ſpirits and comfort thy ſoul in what kinde ſoever it is afflicted. Here alſo thou ſhalt finde that many of Gods dear ſervants have ſuffered as great afflictions as thou canſt, and yet God did ſend them comfort and deliverance; but ſpecially what Chriſt thy Saviour hath ſuffered for thee, and what benefit and comfort thou maiſt have by it, if thou canſt draw it to thy ſelf, and make a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to thine own ſorrowful condition, without which it will yeeld thee but ſmall conſolation in thy miſeries. If thou doſt meet with any thing here that will fit thy preſent condition, either for edification, or for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb facs="tcp:118343:4"/> thou muſt ruminate well upon it, to ſuck out the ſpirituall jui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, to imprint it in thy minde, and to bring it cloſe home to thy heart, that it may comfort thy ſoul, and cure thy wounded Spirit. <hi>David</hi> found great comfort when he did Meditate on the Word of God. <hi>My ſoul,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſſe; and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 63. 5, 6</note> 
               <hi>lips; when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> And it muſt needs be ſo: for this is a duty which God requireth, and he takes ſpeciall notice of thoſe that do practice it, to pour down his bleſsings upon them, as he did, upon <hi>Iſaack,</hi> who went out dayly into the field to Meditate<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 63, 64.</note> upon the wonderfull Works of God, and then at that very time God ſent him a vertuous Wife. If the Spirit of God goeth along with thee in thy holy Meditations, they cannot but be comfortable to thy ſoul; thou wilt then conceive aright of the ſecret and hidden things of God, and thou wilt ſee the infinite wiſdom ond power of God in all the Creatures, his goodneſſe and bounty to thee in them, and a glympſe of the Majeſty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the great Creator, God Almighty. His holy Spirit will alſo open thy heart to let in whatſoever ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good thou reapeſt by thy pious Meditations: For if thou lookeſt upon the creature, and doeſt not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſomething of God in it, thou doſt look upon it in vain, and if thou readeſt or heareſt his Word Preached, and doſt not ſettle it upon thy affections by ruminating upon it, thou canſt not edifie thy heart, nor comfort thy ſoul thereby: So likewiſe, if thou doeſt read any thing in this Treatiſe that is comfortable to poor dejected Spirits, it will not comfort thee, if it be not well digeſted in thy heart, and applyed to thine own
<pb facs="tcp:118343:4"/> ſoul. If thou art not acquainted with this holy Duty, I have given thee ſome directions how to perform it; and if thou doeſt firſt practiſe it upon thy ſelf, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon thine own condition, what thou art by nature, and what by grace, and conſidereſt ſeriouſly in thy thoughts what way thou walkeſt, what ſteps thou treadeſt, and to what end thy wayes do tend, thou wilt not onely come to the knowledge of thy ſelf; but thou wilt alſo learn how to Meditate profitably and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably upon God thy Creator, upon Jeſus Chriſt thy Redeemer, and upon the Holy Ghoſt thy Sanctifier and Comforter. I conclude with this ſaying of an ancient Father: Nothing is found more ſweet in this life, nothing is conceived more comfortable, nothing doth ſo ſeparate the affections from the love of this world, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo fortifie the minde againſt temptations, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo ſtir up man, and further him to every good work and duty, as the grace and benefit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Meditation, and heavenly contemplation.</p>

               <head>Meditation is a Duty which God requireth.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E read in the ſacred Scriptures that God commanded his people <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 6. 8, 9.</note>, to binde the Words of his Law for a ſign upon their hands, and to be as frontlets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their eyes, to write them upon the poſts of their houſes, and on their gates, to teach them diligently unto their children, to talk of them in their houſes, and to think upon them, when they walk by the way, when they lye down and when they riſe up: all which was to this end and purpoſe, <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 11 18.</note> that they might lay up his Words in their hearts, and in their ſoules, to meditate upon them for their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for their ſpirituall comfort, and for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a vertuous life, and holy Converſation. This is the counſell of the wiſeman, <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 7. 3</note> To binde the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon our fingers, and to write them upon the table of our hearts, that we may be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, and to meditate on them upon all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118343:7"/> occaſions. <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Timothy</hi> diverſe holy precepts, concerning his life and doctrine, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15</note> and then he gave him expreſſe charge to meditate upon them, and to give himſelf wholy to them, that they might be well faſtned in his heart to obſerve them. Alſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> was dead, God made <hi>Joſhua</hi> the chief commander of his people, and appointed him to bring them into the land of Canaan, and to give them the poſſeſſion of it; which was a work ſo great, ſo difficult, and ſo dangerous, by reaſon of the great ſtrength of the inhabitants of that Land, as might make <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſhrink from it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to undertake it; but God did encourage him by many gracious promiſes of his aſſiſtance, to make him able to effect it, and therefore he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him three ſeverall times, to be ſtrong and of a good courage, not to be afraid, but to reſt upon his Word for ſtrength and ability to do that work whereunto God had called him, and would aſſuredly perform his Word, if he did obſerve to do according to all the Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded him, and not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that he might proſper whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he went: Wherefore God ſaith thus unto him, <note n="e" place="margin">Joſh. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou maiſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſſe. Have not I commanded thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an holy duty which ought to be fixed upon holy things, and performed to an holy end: for it is very uſefull and profitable, very ſweet and comfortable to every true Believers ſoul, if it be rightly performed. The Saints and ſervants of God have been very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the practice of this duty, whoſe hearts were inlarged to meditate upon heavenly &amp; ſpiritual things, &amp; they did thereby draw true conſolation to their ſouls. <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 63. 6</note> This was holy <hi>Davids</hi> exerciſe day and night; <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the precepts and Statutes of God, <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal 143. 5.</note> ſometimes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118343:7"/> on his wonderfull Acts, and excellent Works; <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 104. 34</note> and his heart found great ſweetneſſe in theſe his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Now then it is richly worth our pains to get this Art of Divine Meditation: for it will increaſe our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of his Laws, it will make grace more fruitfull in us, and our ſorrows leſſe grievous: It will alſo ſtrengthen our faith in the promiſes of God, to make us ſtout and couragious in his Cauſe, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the aſſaults of the divell, and all the oppoſitions of wicked men. How can we be edified by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, if we let it depart out of our mindes, and do not chew the cud, and ruminate upon it in our hearts? How can we teach our children and ſervants the Lawes of God, if they come not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our own meditations? How can our wayes be proſperous here upon earth, &amp; how can we hope to have good ſucceſſe in what we take in hand, if we do not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſomething concerning God day and night? If we neglect this pious Duty, we do then eſtrange our ſelves from God, and we bereave our ſouls of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall benefits and comforts which otherwiſe they might receive, and we loſe a great part of the comfort of our lives.</p>
               <p>But this Art is not eaſily learned, common grace or humane learning cannot attain unto it: for the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart cannot be raiſed up to heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, if they are not ſeaſoned with ſanctifying grace; neither can they delight in ſpirituall things, if they are clogged with earthly cares, or drawn away after worldly vanities. A true child of God is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prepared to meditate as he ought, to make his meditations edifying and comfortable to his ſoul: for the inward corruptions of his unregenerate part will hinder him, the thoughts of his worldly affairs will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract his minde, that he cannot be ſo well diſpoſed for ſuch an heavenly duty, or elſe the divell will be ready
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118343:8"/> to ſuggeſt unto him evill thoughts, or to bring into his remembrance ſome of his former ſins, to diſquiet the peace of his conſcience, to trouble the tranquillity of his minde, and ſo to interrupt his thoughts, that his meditations may not be for the honour of God, nor yet fruitfull and profitable to himſelf; and therefore he muſt crave the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of GOD by Prayer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Rules of direction for our holy Meditations.</head>
               <p>VVHerefore now, that our Meditations may be holy and acceptable to God, and that we may finde ſweetneſſe and comfort in them, we muſt carefully obſerve theſe few Directions following,</p>
               <p>The firſt is, to fix our meditations upon holy things, and not upon that which is vain and unprofitable: for they do moſt conduce to the glory of God, and to the comfort of our ſoules. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell, <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 3. 1, 2</note> to <hi>ſet our affections on things above, not on things on the earth:</hi> whereby we ſhall give a clear evidence, that we are riſen with Chriſt from the death of ſin to the life of grace. As our affections are carried, ſo are our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: if they are carried to worldly vanities, our mindes will be ſo incumbered, that we cannot freely meditate upon thoſe things that concern the Kingdom of heaven, neither will our meditations be for Gods glory, or for our eternall good. But if our affections are carried toward heavenly things, then our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be ſpirituall and heavenly, and our actions will be tending to the honour of God. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> ſet his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the houſe of his God, and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared abundantly of his own proper good, of gold and ſilver which he gave to the building of it. Wherefore it concerneth us very much to keep our hearts cloſe unto God, that our minds may be raiſed up to him in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118343:8"/> contemplations, and that he may be glorified in all our actions:</p>
               <p>The ſecond direction is, that our meditations muſt be of the heart, as well as of the brain; otherwiſe this Duty is not ſo performed that God will accept it. It is the heart which God reſpecteth in all our ſervices to him; without which our beſt duties are not regarded. <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 2. 19</note> The bleſſed Virgin kept all the ſayings of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and others concerning Chriſt, and pondered them in her heart. Oh, how acceptable is that ſacrifice which is offered up to God with a pure and perfect heart? how effectuall is that Prayer which is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him with a true and faithfull heart? how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing are thoſe Almes to God that are given to the poor with a willing heart? and how comfortable are thoſe meditations which proceed from an upright heart? The brain may work, and the cogitations of the minde may be ſet upon holy objects, and all to little purpoſe, if the affections of the heart be wanting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the end of our meditations muſt crown the work with gracious acceptance, and this muſt be the glory of God. We do greatly honour God in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations when we ruminate upon his incomprehenſible Eſſence, how infinite he is in all his Divine Attributes, and how wonderfull in all his works: alſo, when we meditate upon his Law, and upon his gracious promiſes to us in Chriſt, if hereby we are brought to reverence and adore his Sacred Majeſty, to love him for his goodneſſe, and to yield due obedience unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and if we can reſt upon his promiſes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern his wiſdome and glory by his Works. This muſt be the main end of our meditations; and if we do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly meditate upon the holy things of God to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, then God will accept them, and we ſhall be edified by them. But if we propound any other end to our ſelves, whether it be for diſcourſe or vain-glory, or the like, we ſeek not the honour of God herein, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118343:9"/> we delude our ſelves, and defraud our ſouls of that heavenly comfort which otherwiſe they might have.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, our hearts and conſciences muſt be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and cleanſed from dead works by faith, and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that an holy zeal may be kindled in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that our ſouls may feel the comfort of a ſpirituall warmth by our holy meditations. For if there be any guilt of ſin that cleaveth faſt to our conſciences, becauſe we have no aſſurance by repentance, that it is waſht away in the blood of Chriſt by faith, it will cool the zeal of our affections, and ſtop the current of Gods aſſiſting grace; ſo that our meditations can make no holy impreſſion in our hearts, no print of Piety in our lives and converſations; neither can they ſend forth any beams of true conſolation to our ſouls. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if our hearts are not ſanctified and ſeaſoned with grace, our meditations cannot be to the glory of God, nor to our own ſpirituall good, neither can we ſay as the Pſalmiſt did <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 104 34.</note> My meditation of God ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord. This will move our hearts and affections, and will put a ſpirituall life into our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, when our hearts are cleanſed from the guilt of ſin; ſo that we can freely meditate upon the bounty and goodneſſe of God in all his dealings with us: this we may do if faith goeth along in all our holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we muſt have ſome ſpirituall underſtanding in thoſe things whereon we deſire to meditate, that the holy Ghoſt may guide us in our meditations, and then we ſhall glorifie God, and comfort our ſouls thereby; otherwiſe the thoughts of our hearts will wander, and go far aſtray from the matter, whereupon they ſhould be fixed; and we may eaſily loſe our ſelves in the dark, if the ſpirit of God doth not give us ſome ſpiritual light, to guide and direct us therein, and we can receive no benefit by this holy ſervice, if it be not performed with an underſtanding heart. The more knowledge we have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118343:9"/> of what we intend to meditate, the more will our hearts be enlarged for it, and the deeper impreſſions will our meditations make in our affections, and the greater will be the comfort of our ſouls. This was the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 49. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The meditation of my heart ſhall be of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 15</note> 
                  <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo; I will ſing with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſpirit, and I wil ſing with the underſtanding alſo:</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt meditate with the ſpirit, and with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo. How can we learn the Commandements of God, and how can we keep his Law, if the Lord doth not give us underſtanding in them by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>This heavenly wiſdome is the gift of God, which we muſt with all care and diligence labour for, according to this of <hi>Solomon:</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Wiſdome is the principall thing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore get Wiſdom: and with all thy getting get underſtanding.</hi> This is a ſpeciall meanes to come to the true way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and devout meditation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, We muſt dayly practice this religious duty, and if we learn to meditate upon our ſelves, what our ſtate and condition is, whether it be of nature or of grace, it will bring us to the meditation of ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>Though it be a very hard matter for a true childe of God to meditate upon heavenly things for his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort; yet by uſe and exerciſe we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto it, and the ſweetneſſe that we ſhall find in it will by degrees bring us to delight in this pious duty. <note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0</note> 
                  <hi>For</hi> by this meanes <hi>we ſhall have our converſation in heaven,</hi> though we live upon earth, and we ſhall enjoy heaven and heavenly happineſſe in ſome part while we live in this world: for if we be frequent in our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Kingdome of heaven, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12</note> the grace of God will make our converſation in this world to be in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Direction is, to chooſe ſuch times, and ſuch places as are moſt fitting and moſt convenienient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118343:10"/> for this holy duty, that we be not interrupted by any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of worldly occaſions, but that our mindes and our hearts may agree, and go together in our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The fitteſt time for this religious ſervice is, when God is pleaſed to give an inclination of will, and to move our hearts thereunto by his holy Spirit: which time we ought not to let ſlip, nor to loſe this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which he tendereth to us; becauſe it is the time for grace of his own chooſing, and the time which he will accept.</p>
               <p>If we take this time and ſet it apart to imploy our ſelves in this holy ſervice, he will then inlarge our hearts for it, he will direct us in it, and he will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſiſt us with his Spirit, to conceive aright of thoſe things whereon we do intend to meditate. As we muſt be free at that time from all incumberances by our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; ſo we muſt retire to ſuch a place, where we may be ſolitary and private, that our hearts may wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our meditations.</p>
               <p>A ſolitary field is a fitting place to ruminate upon the works of God: <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 6. 6.</note> Our cloſet is moſt convenient to meditate on the Law of God. If we chooſe ſuch times and places, we may freely delight our ſelves with heavenly and ſpirituall contemplations.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt prepare our hearts for this pious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by faithfull prayer, that God will be pleaſed to aid and aſſiſt us herein with his bleſſed Spirit, to raiſe up our affections, to enlighten our underſtandings, and to purge and cleanſe our hearts from all ſinful thoughts, worldly cares, and from every evill concupiſence, that we may fully devote our ſelves to the meditation of heavenly things, that this holy ſervice may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the glory af God, to the increaſe of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge, to the ſtrengthening of our faith and confidence in God, &amp; to carry us on cheerfully through all the troubleſome chances and changes, that are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118343:10"/> to this life: for our holy Meditations will lift up our hearts and affections above all worldly cares, and above all the croſſes and ſorrows that we ſhall meet with here upon earth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Holy Meditation is the prerogative onely of a true Chriſtian.</head>
               <p>AMong many Prerogatives that a true believing Chriſtian hath above all other men, this is not the leaſt, that he can raiſe up the Affections of his heart to heavenly contemplations, by the power of the Spirit of grace that is in him: whereas unregenerate men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain to this high degree of true Chriſtianity by all the meanes that art or nature can afford them: for their Meditations reach but to the notions of the brain, and are practiſed onely by the outward man, which can yield them no ſpirituall conſolation; becauſe they have not the power of grace to move the affections of the heart to heavenly things, which only can miniſter ſweetneſs &amp; true conſolation to an afflicted ſoul, and to a troubled conſcience, to give them good hope and aſſurance of the grace and favour of God, and of the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of their ſins.</p>
               <p>Carnall men ſet their mindes and affections upon carnall delights; voluptuous men do dayly ſtudy how to ſatisfie their ſouls with unprofitable pleaſures, and worldly minded men ſet their hearts upon covetouſneſs, and upon the pomp and vanity of this preſent world.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like kinde of men are ſo preſſed down with the burden of ſin, and they are ſo encumbered with worldly cares and ſinfull delights, that they have no power to mount up toward heaven in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and no hearts fit for Divine contemplations; becauſe they have no intereſt in Chriſt; and therefore they can have no ſpirituall light to diſcern aright of heavenly things.</p>
               <p>But a true believing Chriſtian hath the light of Gods
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118343:11"/> Spirit to give him ſpiritual underſtanding, he hath ſtrength of grace to withſtand all ſpirituall lets and hinderances, and to raiſe up his affections above all earthly things, &amp; with the wings of faith he can mount up above all the blocks and impediments, that the divell or wicked men can caſt in his way to depreſſe his ſpirits, and to keep down the cogitations of his heart from pious and devout Meditations.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that the deareſt of Gods ſervants cannot ſometimes perform this religious Duty as they ſhould, becauſe they do often finde the fleſh to war againſt the ſpirit, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 21, 23.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and that they are ſo yoked with their unregenerate part, that when they would do good, either for the glory of God, or for the comfort of their own ſouls, evill is preſent with them, which doth diſturb the peace of their conſciences, the quiet of their mindes, and the freedome of their ſpirits; and doth alſo ſtop the ſweet influence of comfort that ſhould come to their ſouls: but eſpecially they are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their Meditations, which is a Duty meerly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and cannot be performed but by the ſpirit; yet through Chriſt they get the victory, and they will break through all oppoſition, becauſe <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 7. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>they delight in the Law of God,</hi> and in heavenly contemplations after the inward man, and their mindes will be ſet at liberty to ſerve him, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 25.</note> though with the fleſh they do ſometimes ſerve the law of ſin.</p>
               <p>If we have given up our names unto Chriſt, and are liſted in his roul to fight under his banner, we muſt look for continuall conflicts and combates with our ſpirituall enemies, which dayly ſeek to ruine our ſouls by hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in our Religious duties; but we are ſure to have comfort in Chriſt; and power from him to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and to get the conqueſt over them all, if we can raiſe up our hearts to contemplate his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power, his infinite Wiſdome, and his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care of us.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118343:11"/>
               <p>Sometimes we have conflicts with pleaſure, and plenty; ſometimes with afflictions and penury, with ſin and temptations, with pain and ſickneſſe, and with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of death: all which for a time may hinder the freedome of our ſpirits, that we cannot compoſe our thoughts, nor ſettle our hearts for holy Meditations; but we ſhall recover our ſelves again by the power of Chriſt, whoſe Grace is ſufficient to hold us up againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whatſoever, and to ſet our hearts in ſuch a frame as is fitting for the performance of this holy Duty.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 6. 11, 12.</note> ſeeing we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, and againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſe in high places; we muſt put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devill. <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 3, 4.</note> Though we walk in the fleſh, we do not war after the fleſh: for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame power that pulleth down the ſtrong holds of ſin in us, and the ſinfull imaginations of our mindes, will alſo raiſe up the affections of our hearts to devout and pious Meditations of the heavenly and ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>The more free we keep our hearts from worldly cares and our mindes from ſinfull thoughts, the fitter we ſhall be for this holy Duty, the better we ſhall perform it, and we ſhall reap the more comfort by it.</p>
               <p>But unregenerate men are not acquainted with this ſpirituall armour, they have no power againſt their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies, they have no weapons fit for this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: for untill they are brought out of their naturall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118343:12"/> condition into the State of grace, &amp; have intereſt in Chriſt by faith they are ſo clogged with their worldly affairs, ſo wedded to earthly vanities, and ſo intangled with the corruptions of their nature, that there is no room in their hearts for any holy contemplations, and they have no grace that can give them ſtrength to fight againſt the allurements of the world, the intiſements of the fleſh, and the cunning ſtratagems of the devill.</p>

               <p>Wherefore, empty thy heart of all ſinfull cogitations, and lay aſide all thy worldly cares, that thou maiſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet thy minde upon God, to contemplate with all fear &amp; due reverence ſomething of his excellencies and greatneſſe, ſo far as God hath revealed himſelf, and according to the meaſure of that heavenly knowledge which he hath given thee: let thy Meditations of theſe things be guided with good underſtanding, and let them be bounded with Chriſtian ſobriety, leſt thou be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the depth of this infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ocean.</p>

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo did ſee in a viſion the Majeſty of this great and terrible God, which is recorded in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, to teach us thereby what a Prince of Majeſty is, and how dreadfull in his judgements, when he is offended.</p>
               <p>Now conſider what maketh it ſo dreadful to Meditate on God; it is not onely the conſideration of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible and Divine Eſſence, or the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent glory of his ſacred Majeſty, or his infinite Power, whereby all creatures, all principalities and powers are under his ſubjection; but alſo the conſideration of the frailty and weakneſſe of our nature, and the vileneſſe of our condition by reaſon of our many ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we have offended him, and juſtly incurred his high diſpleaſure, and have deſerved his wrath and fury to be poured out upon us, whereby we ſtand in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fear of his judgements, and of the ſeverity of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>For if we have a true ſight of our own baſeneſſe, that we are but as clay in the hand of the Potter, or as an earthen pitcher which is eaſily broken in pieces, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be afraid to draw near ſo great and glorious a Majeſty, to contemplate his greatneſſe and power, the breath of whoſe Noſtrils is able to conſume us.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider that our ſins have laid us open to the rigour of his juſtice, and have juſtly moved him to pour down upon us the full vialls of his wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to our eternall deſtruction; it muſt needs then ſtrike terrour into our hearts, when we come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in our heavenly Meditations: for he is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenging God, <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> and a conſuming fire, he will ſuffer no ſin to go unpuniſhed.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118343:13"/>
               <p>This doth make our ſins the more hainous, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them the more grievous; becauſe they are committed againſt an Omnipotent and moſt glorious God, from whom we had our firſt being, and from whoſe goodneſſe we do dayly receive all bleſſings, both ſpirituall and temporall that are needfull for us.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we cannot Meditate with comfort upon God, when the guilt of our ſins cleaveth to our ſouls: We cannot chearfully lift up our hearts unto him, when our conſciences do accuſe us of ſin, that we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God our Creator, and that we lye under the curſe of his Law, and are in continuall expectation to have the penalty of it inflicted upon us, which we know we have juſtly deſerved.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with us until we can apprehend God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto us by the merit of the death of Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we muſt apply to our own hearts by faith.</p>
               <p>When God doth viſite us with afflictions and troubles, as he hath done to many of his dear ſervants, that we feel the ſmart of his rod, and his hand heavy upon us, it will take away the comfort of our Meditations, and make us afraid of his judgements, as it was with holy <hi>Job, David</hi> and others; becauſe ſometimes they are very terrible to us.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith <hi>Job</hi> unto God in his afflictions: <note n="m" place="margin">Iob. 13. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thine hand far from me, and let not thy dread make me afraid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again he ſaith thus, <note n="n" place="margin">Iob 6. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The terrours of God do ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in array againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God be ſo dreadfull to his own ſervants, how then can the wicked and ſinners appear before him? how can they withſtand his judgements, or bear the fierceneſſe of his wrath and fury? he caſt the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Angels out of heaven without any hope of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; he caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, and laid a ſevere curſe upon the earth for his ſake, and upon all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for his ſin: he drowned the whole world, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118343:14"/> conſumed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire: he gave his own people into the hands of their enemies for their tranſgreſſions, and brought grievous judgements upon many particular offenders. Wherefore we cannot deny but that the Meditation of theſe and the like works of Gods juſtice muſt needs be dreadful and uncomfortable to us, if we look onely upon the juſtice of God, and not alſo upon his mercy.</p>
               <p>But above all it is moſt dreadfull to Meditate upon the day of judgement, when we muſt appear before this great and terrible God, to give a ſtrict account unto him of whatſoever we have done here in the fleſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ioel. 2. 11.</note> That day is great and terrible, who can abide it?

                  <hi>The earth ſhall remove out of her place in the wrath of the LORD of hoſts, and in the day of his fierce anger, and it ſhall be as the chaſed Roe, and as the ſheep that no man taketh up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhall they ſee all ſepulchers open, and to yield forth their dead bodies of all men, high and low, rich and poor, to ſtand there naked before the Judge, and before his Angels, and in the face of all creatures: their ſins ſhall be revealed, their ſecret offences ſhall be laid open, and they ſhall be conſtrained to give an account of thoſe things, whereof they would diſdain to have been told in this life.</p>
               <p>Conſider now who can Meditate upon the eternall God, this great and terrible Judge without much fear and dread, if he cannot appear before him with a good conſcience; and who can think upon that fearfull day of account without much terrour and trouble of ſpirit, if he hath not ſome good aſſurance of the pardon of his ſins by his true repentance, and that he is reconciled to God by faith in Chriſt? Wealth and honours cannot help, the Judge will not be partiall, neither will he be corrupted, an evill conſcience will not be ſilent, no interceſſion of worldly friends can prevail at that day: all things wil cry for vengeance upon the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, to yield them cauſe of fear and terrour; but nothing will yield them any hope of comfort.</p>
               <p>Above them ſhall be their dreadfull Judge, who is offended with them for their wickedneſſe; beneath them they ſhall ſee hell open, and the cruell furnace ready
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118343:15"/> boyling to receive then; on their right hand their ſins accuſing them; on the left hand the divels are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to execute Gods eternall ſentence of condemnation upon them; within them is conſcience gnaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng like the worm that dieth not, becauſe it is full of the guilt of ſin, without them all damned ſouls are howling and yelling, and on every ſide the whole world is burning. What ſhall a wretched ſinner now do, that carrieth the guilt of his ſins with him to this great day of judgement? how can his heart bear theſe fearfull perplexities? What way will he take to eſcape this dreadfull judgement? to go back it is impoſſible, to go forward is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; death will ſlee from him, the grave cannot hold him, the hills cannot cover him, but there he muſt ſtand as a miſerable forlorn and deſperate wretch, untill he receive this dolefull and irrecoverable ſentence. Go ye curſed into everlaſtingfire; the thought of theſe things cannot be but moſt terrible.</p>
               <p>Now it concerneth every one to ſet his heart in an holy frame of fear and reverence, and to humble his ſoul greatly before God, when he intendeth to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon the glorious Majeſty of this great Judge, or upon this great and terrible day, when a moſt ſevere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall be required of every one, of whatſoever they have done in this life, whether it be good or evill; alſo when they meditate on the fearfull ſentence which ſhall then be pronounced againſt all offenders, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon them to all eternity, without any hope of eaſe or remedy.</p>
               <p>This is not to deter or afright us from an holy &amp; pious Meditation of theſe things, though they be every ſad and dolefull to naturall men, neither is it to drive us into deſpair, as if there were no hope to ſtand before this Judge with comfort at that day, or to avoid that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence of condemnation: but it is to ſtir us up to uſe all care and diligence to make our peace with God in time, and to get a modeſt and a ſober aſſurance of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118343:15"/> the pardon of our ſins by repentance; and that by a true and lively faith we may be united unto Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, who ſhall be then our Judge.</p>
               <p>This conſideration muſt needs comfort us much, if we have any clear evidence that we belong unto Chriſt. To this end <note n="u" place="margin">Mark 13.</note> Chriſt foretold his diſciples the fearfull manner of his coming to judgement, that they ſhould watch and pray, that ſo it might not come ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to finde them ſleeping in ſecurity, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for it; and what he ſaid unto them, he ſaith unto all, that we ſhould alſo watch and pray, to eſcape the great danger of that terrible day, and to ſtand with confidence before the throne of the Son of Man at that time.</p>

               <p>Thus we may meet the day of judgement with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if we can earneſtly long after it, and can heartily deſire to meet our Lord Chriſt, when he cometh in the clouds unto judgement; which we cannot do untill we find by due examination that we are in the ſtate of grace, and that by faith we are inveſted into the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and have lived unto God, and not unto our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thus ſaith the ſon of <hi>Sirach,</hi>

                  <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This trying and judging of our ſelves muſt be done in this life: for after death there is no faith, no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and no reformation of life: if we die in our ſins,

               <p>IF we deſire to make our Meditations on God to be comfortable to our ſouls, we muſt not look onely upon his greatneſſe, but alſo upon his goodneſſe: for our ſhallow Meditations cannot reach ſo far, as to draw any true comfort to our ſelves from the conſideration of of his greatneſſe and power, unleſſe we do alſo look upon his goodneſſe to us in Chriſt, which doth open a fountain of true conſolation to us, not onely in our Meditations of him, but alſo in our ſufferings for him. So likewiſe if we look onely upon the juſtice of God without any relation to his mercies in Chriſt, we ſhall find little comfort in our Meditations of him: for we cannot but quake and tremble at the ſeverity of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; becauſe we have broken all his commandements, and have tranſgreſſed his Law, and therefore we lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe and penalty of it.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if we look vpon our ſelves altogether as we are by nature, polluted and ſtained with the guilt of ſin, both originall and actuall, without any relation to the blood of Chriſt by faith, it will make us aſhamed to come into the preſence of God, and afraid to think upon him; becauſe he is a ſin-revenging God, and will not ſuffer ſin to go unpuniſhed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now we may receive plenty of ſpiritual comfort, when we meditate on God, either in his greatneſſe or in his goodneſſe, in his juſtice, or in his mercy: for by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, which Chriſt hath made for us, God doth not now look upon us as his enemies, or as rebels to him; but he takes us for his own people, and as his ſervants, <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 31. 33.</note> according to his promiſe in the new Covenant: and alſo as his children by adoption in Chriſt, which makes the Meditations of our hearts ſweet and comfortable to our ſouls.</p>

                  <hi>Behold, I will bring forth my ſervant, the Branch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This honour have all they that truly believe in Chriſt, becauſe he hath reconciled them to God his Father, and hath made them his ſervants by grace.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, if we have any clear evidence to our conſciences, that we are the ſervants of God by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this atonement, if we do ſerve and obey him with faithfull hearts, in ſincerity and in truth; we may then cheerfully fix our Meditations upon God, which will be acceptable in his ſight, and comfortable to our own ſouls. For by this ſweet relation that we have unto God through faith in Chriſt, our duties and ſervices to him will be accepted, though they be imperfectly performed by us, if we ſhew our beſt care to pleaſe him from an upright heart, as his faithfull ſervants ought to do. Alſo we may apply our ſelves by holy ſupplications to our heavenly Lord, as being his ſervants to protect us from our enemies, to provide for us in our neceſſities, to ſuccour us in our tribulations, and to countenance us as his ſervants in all our temptations, that our faith may not fail us, and that our ſpirits may not ſink under the burden of them.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever we want we may have it of God, and whatſoever we fear may come upon us, he will prevent it, or fit us for it, or elſe he will ſanctifie it for our good, that we may find comfort in it. Wherefore we need not be afraid to contemplate his greatneſſe, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118343:17"/> will ſweeten that fear; we need not fear death in a ſervile way, for it hath no ſting to hurt us: and we need not be terrified at the Majeſty of the great Judge of quick and dead, nor at the rigour and ſeverity of his juſtice at the day of judgement; for Chriſt Jeſus ſhall be then our Judge, who is now our Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>We cannot then but ſhew our duty to God, and our love to Chriſt by our willing and ready obedience to the commands of God, and by our thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Redemption wrought by Chriſt, by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating on his Word, and by contemplating his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works: our thoughts will be continually upon him, our delight will be to Meditate on him, and the affections of our hearts will be alwayes towards him</p>
               <p>Conſider further what Chriſt hath done for us, that we may the more comfortably Meditate on God: he hath not onely redeemed us out of the ſervitude of ſin and Satan, and made us the ſervants of God by grace; but alſo, <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 1. 12</note> 
                  <hi>he hath given power to as many as believe on his Name to become the ſons of God;</hi> which priviledge and honour we have onely by faith, <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 4. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>who hath redeemed us that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons. And becauſe we are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his ſon into our hearts, crying Abba Ftther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How comfortable then will our Meditations be to our ſouls, when we ruminate upon God as he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? what can deject our ſpirits, or make us afraid, if we have a ſure confidence that God is our Father? Can we be brought to a lower degree of miſery, than <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 15. 18, 19.</note> the poor prodigall in the Goſpel was? and yet when he remembred his Father, he was comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>
               <p>Can any poor ſoul be deeper plunged in ſin, or lead a more vicious life than this prodigall did? and yet his Father did not caſt him off, but upon his true ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118343:18"/> he received him again as his ſon. Why then ſhould we deſpair of mercy, though our ſins are many and very great?</p>
               <p>Why ſhould we fear the terrours of death, if we be well perſwaded of our adoption? for <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 4. 7.</note>
                  <hi>we are heirs of God through Chriſt,</hi> and we go to poſſeſſe that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which belongeth to us as ſons; and why ſhould the thought of the day of judgement be terrible to us, ſeeing Chriſt our Redeemer will make up our accounts for us, and will perfect with his own righteouſneſſe whatſoever is wanting on our parts? Do we think that Chriſt will redeem us out of the bondage of Satan, and will free us from the ſtrictneſſe of the Law, the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, &amp; from the ſting of death, and at laſt will leave us to our ſelves to anſwer the rigour of Gods juſtice for whatſoever we have done here in the fleſh? Surely no: for then the Work of our Redemption had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finiſhed; but Chriſt will be then our hiding place, he will cover all our ſins under the Robe of his own Righteouſneſſe, and will ſhelter us from the fierceneſs of Gods wrath, and from the ſeverity of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>We have now much matter for Divine and Heavenly Meditations to comfort and refreſh our languiſhing ſouls, when they are any way perplexed with ſorrowes, feares, or doubtings, if we ruminate upon our happy condition by being in grace and favour with God: for we have the honour and dignity to be the ſervants of the great King of heaven and earth by the right of purchaſe, and ſo are none but ſuch onely whom Chriſt hath bought with his own blood.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if we Meditate upon our Adoption it wil be very comfortable to us, and exceeding ſweet to our ſpirituall taſte: for Chriſt hath given us hereby all the priviledges of ſons, both in what we are freed from, and in what we have right unto: for we are freed from all evill of ſin, and from all evill of puniſhment: ſin hath no power
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118343:18"/> to condemn us, though it will ſtill moleſt and trouble us; and there is no evill in our afflictions and ſufferings, becauſe the nature of them is changed into Fatherly chaſtiſements, which conduce to our good, and not to our hurt. Alſo, we may draw great conſolation from our Adoption, if we Meditate upon the right, which we have thereby to all the promiſes of God, to all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinances, to all his bleſſings, to whatſoever is good for us, or we ſtand in need of, and alſo to an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance after this life is ended.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the mercies of God to us in Chriſt, they will afford us matter enough of comfortable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for if we ſearch the Scriptures, <note n="m" place="margin">Zech. 13. 1.</note> we ſhall find <hi>a fountain of mercy that God hath opened to the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin and for nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe;</hi> wherein we may waſh away all the guilt and ſtains of our ſins, if we can apply the ſtreames thereof to our hearts by faith: this Fountain is the blood of Chriſt, which the holy Ghoſt here meaneth; <note n="n" place="margin">Joh. 4. 10</note> 
                  <hi>In Chriſt we ſhall finde water of life to refreſh our panting ſouls,</hi> when we are in any diſtreſſe, or lye languiſhing under the ſenſe of our ſins.</p>

               <p>His wiſdome will teach us the way of truth, it will guide us in it, and it will diſpoſe of all things for our good.</p>
               <p>His Righteouſneſſe is a garment of ſalvation to us; his Spirit of grace will inrich us with all heavenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, to lead an holy and ſanctified life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>

               <p>Let us conſider alſo for our further comfort in our Meditations on God, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 3. 17</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt, the eternall ſon of God, doth ſpiritually dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> and he doth not come to lodge with us as a gueſt, or to ſojourn there for a time, and then to be gone from us; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to abide and to dwell with us for ever, he hath taken up his habitation there, and our faith will cleave ſo cloſe to him, that he will never depart from us, neither will he ſuffer us to depart from him.</p>
               <p>We read that <hi>Ittai</hi> the <hi>Gittite,</hi> one of <hi>Davids</hi> worthies would not leave the King when he fled from his ſon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> but he anſwered the King in this manner: <note n="t" place="margin">2 Sam. 15 21</note> 
                  <hi>As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the King liveth, ſurely, in what place my Lord the King ſhall be, whether in death or life, even there alſo will thy ſervant be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus cloſe doth our faith cleave unto Chriſt: for it will not ſuffer us to leave him, neither will he leave us, but our faith will be ſtill with Chriſt, both in life and in death.</p>
               <p>O happy is our condition if we have ſuch an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in our hearts: if Chriſt hath ſetled his abode there, he wil execute his Prieſtly Office, to make interceſſion to his heavenly Father for us, <note n="u" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 3</note> and he wil make us a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prieſthood to offer up ourſelves and our prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to preſent unto him our ſpirituall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and oblations, our thanks and praiſes for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and mercies received, and a broken and contrite heart for ſins committed, which ſacrifices God will not refuſe.</p>
               <p>Chriſt will alſo execute his Propheticall Office in our hearts, to teach and inſtruct us the right way to true holineſſe and godlineſſe of life and converſation, and how to attain unto eternall ſalvation in the life to come. So likewiſe Chriſt will rule and reign in our hearts as King by his Spirit of grace, to order and govern us in all our wayes and actions, to over-rule and ſubdue all the Spirituall enemies of our ſalvation, to protect and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118343:19"/> keep us from all perills and dangers, to provide for us what is needfull for our good, and alſo to comfort us in all our ſorrowes, and in the anguiſh of our ſouls, to keep us out of the power of the devill at the hour of death, and <note n="u" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8</note> 
                  <hi>to give us a crown of righteouſneſſe, which he hath laid up for us at the day of his appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is yet more matter of comfort to be drawn from Chriſt in our Meditations of him, when he doth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dwell in our hearts, and that by faith we do injoy his ſacred ſociety: for he doth cloth us with his own Righteouſneſſe for our juſtification, and he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow us with the graces of his Spirit for our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that through him we may be able to overcome the world, the fleſh, and the devill, and ſo to over-power the corruptions of our nature, that our ſinful luſts, and the evill concupiſcence of our fleſh ſhal not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us; <note n="x" place="margin">Rom 8. 16</note> 
                  <hi>and his ſpirit will bear witneſſe with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt will alſo put a ſpirituall light into our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſcern the things of God, which a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man cannot do, and to know our own condition, from whence we are fallen, and how to be recovered; he will give us grace upon the ſight and ſenſe of our ſins to be truly humbled for them, to repent and turn to the Lord; for he delighteth to dwell with thoſe that are of a broken and a contrite heart; according as he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his Prophet: <note n="y" place="margin">Iſaiah 57 15</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe Name is holy, I dwell in the high and lofty place; with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt will alſo change the perverſeneneſſe of the will, to put it into a frame of conformity to the will of God, and he will take off the immoderate affections of our hearts from all earthly things, and will raiſe them up to heavenly contemplations, to ſtudy holineſſe of life, to love that which Chriſt loveth, to delight in his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118343:20"/> Commandments, and in his Ordinances, and to practiſe with a willing minde all holy duties which he requireth, both to God and to our neighbour, in Publick and in private, at home in our families; and to others upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Then we ſhall find heavenly joy, and ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, when we ſet our hearts to Meditate thus on God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the conſideration of theſe great benefits and comforts which we have by Chriſt, ſhould be ſtrong and prevalent motives to us, to prepare our hearts to receive him, to inlarge our affections with holy deſires to imbrace him, <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 24. 7</note> and to ſet open the gates and doores of our ſouls, that this King of glory may come in and dwell with us for ever.</p>
               <p>If we do ſincerely from the heart deſire ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King, and ſuch a bountifull Inhabitant to make his perpetuall abode with us, then we muſt preſſe hard upon him, and importune him earneſtly with our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fervent Prayers to abide and dwell with us. <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 19 2, 3.</note> The two Angels that came to <hi>Sodome</hi> refuſed to tarry all night with <hi>Lot</hi> upon his firſt intreaty; but when he preſſed greatly upon them, they turned in unto him, and entered into his houſe, and he made them a feaſt, and they did eat, and then they preſerved him from the burning.</p>
               <p>But behold, <note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 3. 20</note> Chriſt ſtandeth at the door of our hearts and knocks; if we hear his voice, and open the door, he will come in to us, and will ſup with us, we ſhall ſup with him.</p>

                  <hi>If we love father or mother, ſon or daughtor more then Chriſt, we are not worthy of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the affections of our hearts are carried after the riches, preferments, and pleaſures of this world, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any darling ſin; then Chriſt will not dwell there and we loſe the comfortable and bleſſed Preſence of the eternall Son of God, and the fulneſſe of all his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and rich endowments, for that which is nothing elſe but vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now we may Meditate comfortably on God through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour: for the terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Majeſty is clouded with the vail of his goodneſſe, the ſeverity of his juſtice is ſweetened with his mercy and tender compaſſion,</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath taken our ſouls out of the hand of Gods juſtice, and hath put them into the hand of his mercy, where they ſhall be kept for true bleſſedneſſe to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>If his greatneſſe doth affright us, his goodneſſe will allure us; if his juſtice doth drive us from him, his mercy and love will draw us to him: for by Chriſt we have a neer relation to God himſelf, either as his ſervants by grace, or as his children by adoption, in both which reſpects our Meditations of him will be exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to us: So likewiſe if we fix our thoughts upon Chriſt, though his excellencies and dignities are far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of our humane capacity; yet by faith we do apprehend him to be our Redeemer, and our Advocate now at the right hand of God his Father in the higheſt heavens; and therefore our Meditations of him cannot but raviſh our ſouls with heavenly joy, and

               <p>If we fix our Meditations on the holy Ghoſt, as he is in his Divine Eſſence and Being, or as he is one of the three Perſons in the ſacred Trinity, we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in theſe deep myſteries of the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity; but if we Meditate upon him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his proper Office, as he is a Comforter, or according to his ſeverall operations in our hearts, we ſhall then find much comfortable matter for our hearts to Meditate upon, which will miniſter heavenly and ſpirituall conſolation to our poor ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore we muſt conſider that the proper Office of the holy Ghoſt is to be a comforter to us in all our afflictions and ſufferings: for we are dayly expoſed to many tribulations and calamities, either for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Name of Chriſt, for the triall of our graces, or for our correction when we lye in ſin without repentance, which would eaſily ſwallow us up, if we had not ſome true comforter to ſupport and comfort us in them.</p>

               <p>This Balm is the blood of Chriſt, which is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Remedy to cure all the ſpiritual diſeaſes of our ſouls, and none but the holy Ghoſt can apply it to our hearts by Faith.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if the holy Ghoſt doth not refreſh us with the comforts of grace, and with the aſſurance of the love and favour of God, we ſhall be ready to ſink under the great weight of our calamities and miſeries.</p>
               <p>But we may draw comfort enough from the holy Ghoſt in what ſad condition ſoever we be: for he will ſweeten the bitterneſſe of all our ſufferings with true peace of conſcience and tranquility of minde, in the aſſurance of the pardon of our ſins; he will ſanctifie all our afflictions and ſorrowes with ſaving grace, that they ſhall be for our good, and will witneſſe to our ſpirits that we are in grace and favour with God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Alſo, he will give us ſtrength and courage to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt, and for righteouſneſſe ſake, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heavenly wiſedome rightly to uſe every part of the whole armour of God, to defend our ſelves from all our ſpirituall enemies, and to beat back or quench all the fiery darts of the divell, that his temptations and evill ſuggeſtions may not wound our ſouls to the death. Laſtly, he will perfect all with the gift of perſeverance, ſo that we ſhall be able to ſtand faſt in the day of tryall, and we ſhall have aſſured hope of conqueſt and victory in all our conflicts and combates here, and to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with immortall glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now let this be the deſire of our ſouls, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of our hearts to draw comfort from the holy Ghoſt, when we are afflicted, troubled, or any way perplexed with grief of heart, ſorrow of ſpirit, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſoul, which we may do, if we know that no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118343:23"/> outward comforts can ſupport us without God, and therefore we do not reſt and rely upon them; but do ſeek to the true comforter by earneſt and faithfull Prayer in all our neceſſities, which is a ſure means to draw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from him when we want it.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if we be truly ſenſible that we do want his gracious aſſiſtance to carry us on cheerfully through all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers that we ſhal meet with in this world, upon our humble ſupplications to him, he will return us a comfortable anſwer, as ſhall be beſt for us.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, if the guilt of our ſins doth ſtick cloſe unto us, or if we poſſeſſe our former iniquities by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrance of them; ſo that we are truly humbled in the ſight and ſenſe of them, and that our hearts are touched with a godly ſorrow for them; the holy Ghoſt will then come with ſpirituall conſolation to comfort our poor ſouls with an holy aſſurance, that all our ſins are waſht away in the blood of Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may draw comfort from this ſpiritual foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by our pious and devout Meditations of him: for then he will give us a ſweet taſte of his heavenly graces to comfort us in all conditions of life, and he will give us ſpirituall joy in the midſt of all our afflictions: alſo, he will unite us unto Chriſt by Faith, and will ſeal our Redemption to us by his blood, whereby we ſhall enjoy eternal felicity for ever.</p>
               <p>O what ſweet Meditations may we draw from this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Comforter in all the ſadneſſe of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Thus we may Meditate on the holy Ghoſt, as he is the true comforter of our ſouls; we come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of his Divine Operations, from whence we may alſo draw much profitable and comfortable matter for our holy Meditations.</p>
               <p>And for our better underſtanding herein, this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirit of life is ſet forth in the holy Scriptures by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall reſemblances, to ſhew in what manner, and how variouſly he worketh in our hearts, that our Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118343:24"/> may be ordered accordingly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the holy Ghoſt is reſembled to a dove: for when Chriſt was baptized, <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16</note> he deſcended in the ſimilitude of a dove, and reſted upon him, which was to ſhew his ſpirituall anointing to his Office of Mediatorſhip, and to ſet forth the true nature of Chriſt, how humble and and meek he was, how innocent and harmleſſe, how loving, and how ready and willing he was to do good to all.</p>
               <p>Theſe dove-like qualities were poured upon Chriſt above meaſure, that we his members might receive the ſame in ſome meaſure from him by the holy Ghoſt: for he will put all the faculties of our ſouls, all the affections of our hearts, and all the parts of our bodies into a new frame, he will change the corruptions of our nature into an holy temper; of proud and haughty minded he will make us lowly and meek, of hatefull and malicious he will make us loving and courteous to all, he will ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon us with ſanctifying grace throughout, that our evill diſpoſition ſhall be changed into a gracious condition.</p>
               <p>This ſpirit of truth will bring us an Olive leafe, <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 8. 11</note> like <hi>Noahs</hi> dove, to let us know, that though we be in the midſt of troubles, dangers, or diſtreſſes; yet we ſhall be preſerved and delivered, and though we be troubled, diſquieted, or perplexed in our mindes, yet at the laſt we ſhall have peace, tranquillity, ſpirituall joy and comfort</p>
               <p>Now by this reſemblance of the holy Ghoſt we may examine our ſelves what purity and holineſſe he hath wrought in us, what meekneſſe of ſpirit, what patience under the croſſe, what love to God and to our neighbour, and how far we are ſanctified in all the affections of our hearts, &amp; in all the parts of our bodies: alſo, how much the corruptions of our nature are weakned in us, and how far we are changed from that which is ſinful to newneſs of life, if we can finde theſe Operations of the holy Ghoſt in us,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118343:24"/> they wil afford us profitable matter for our hearts to meditate upon to the glory of God, and for the comfort of our own ſoules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome of the operations of the holy Ghoſt are ſet forth unto us by the reſemblance of that <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 13 21</note> pillar of a cloud, which went before the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by day, when they marched out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to guide them the right way that God would have them go toward the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This pillar did alſo protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from their enemies, it kept the ſcorching heat of the Sun from them, and it cooled and moiſtned the earth with ſweet and comfortable dewes, which was a great refreſhing to the people of God in their march through that hot Countrey.</p>
               <p>We are by nature under the ſpiritual bondage of ſin and Satan, which is far worſe than the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was to the Iſraelites; and we have no means to be brought out of it, but by an almighty power; and if God doth deliver us, yet we are ſo ignorant of the way to the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that we cannot ſet one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, except the holy Ghoſt doth put a ſpiritual Light into our underſtanding, to teach and inſtruct us in the right way to heavenly happineſſe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe we ſhal meet with many ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo long as we march thorough the wilderneſſe of this world, the holy Ghoſt will ſo protect and defend us, that they ſhall neither hurt our ſouls by their power, nor keep us out of Canaan by their ſubtilty or malice. He will guide and direct us into all holy duties, he will give us holy deſires and true endeavours to do the will of God, and to walk humbly before him in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the holy Ghoſt doth protect us from the heat of Gods wrath, by working faith in us to lay hold upon the merit of Chriſts death for the pardon of our ſins, and by conferring grace for the ſanctification of our lives.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118343:25"/>
               <p>So likewiſe he doth refreſh and comfort our fainting ſpirits with the ſweet dewes of heavenly conſolations, and he doth mollifie and ſoften our obdurate and ſtony hearts with thoſe influences of grace that deſcend from him, that we may <note n="p" place="margin">Joel 2. 28 Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note> be fruitfull in all good works.</p>
               <p>This holy Spirit doth alſo quench the fire of ſin, which otherwiſe would inflame the whole man with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the holy Ghoſt doth purge and cleanſe the ſoul from the filth of ſin, as water waſheth away the filth of the body.</p>
               <p>This doth God promiſe by his Prophet, <note n="q" place="margin">Zech. 36 25.</note> 
                  <hi>I will pour clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean from all your filthineſſe, and from all your idols will I cleanſe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore we ought ſeriouſly to ruminate upon theſe operations of the holy Ghoſt: for we cannot find the right way to the heavenly Canaan by all that nature or humane learning can afford us, we cannot over power our ſpiritual enemies by our own ſtrength, we have no holy deſires, and no ability in our ſelves to any thing that is good, nothing that is in our power can keep us from the wrath of God, and we have nothing that can refreſh and and comfort our afflicted ſpirits.</p>
               <p>But here we ſhal find that the holy Ghoſt wil be our guide to this heavenly Country, he wil be our Protector againſt all adverſary power, and he wil be a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to us in all our ſorrowes, and upon all occaſions in all conditions of life.</p>
               <p>He will bring us unto Chriſt, and wil firmly unite us unto him by faith: <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.</note> for as the ancient Fathers were all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloud, and all paſſed thorough the ſea, and were all baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cloud and in the ſea; ſo we are baptized unto Chriſt by the holy Ghoſt, that our ſins may be waſhed away in his blood, and that we may be ſanctified by this ſpirit of grace to live in true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all our dayes.</p>
               <p>If we can thus Meditate on the holy Ghoſt, it wil
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118343:25"/> be exceeding profitable and comfortable to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the holy Ghoſt is reſembled to the pillar of fire, that conducted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by night out of <hi>Egypt</hi> toward the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we muſt conſider, that ſuch as are the properties of fire, ſuch are ſome of the operations of the holy Ghoſt in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Fire is the moſt pure Element, and purifies all other elements, it doth naturally mount upward, it is bright and ſhining, and giveth light to all dark places.</p>
               <p>It doth alſo warm and comfort every part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and it is the moſt active of all the other elements; it purifies the gold and burnes away the droſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with the holy Ghoſt; for he is eſſentially pure in himſelf, and purifies every ſoul from dead works into which he comes, he wil not ſuffer any unclean luſt, or evill concupiſcence to have dominion where he dwelleth, and he wil raiſe up the cogitations of the minde, and the affections of the heart to mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in heavenly contemplations. Alſo, whereas by nature <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10, 11.</note> we cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſſe unto us; neither can we know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the holy Ghoſt wil put a ſpiritual light into our hearts, to diſcern the deep things of God: he wil alſo inflame our affections with an holy zeal to the glory of God, and will make our love fervent to the truth. So likewiſe the holy Ghoſt wil melt our hard and ſtony hearts, and make them tender and gracious, flexible and yielding to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holy duty. And whereas our hearts are naturally bound up in unbelief, and heavy and ſluggiſh to any thing that is good, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 32.</note> the holy Ghoſt wil ſo inlarge them that with all cheerfulneſſe of ſpirit, and willingneſſe of minde we ſhall run the way of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, if we have found any of theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118343:26"/> of the holy Ghoſt in our hearts, we ſhal be in ſome meaſure purified and refined from our ſins and pollutions, we ſhall have ſome of the droſſe of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature conſumed, and the heavenly graces of the Spirit of God wil ſhine forth in the integrity of our lives and converſations. Alſo, we ſhall have ſome ſpiritual light to guide our darkned underſtandings in the knowledge of God, and of his wayes, ſome fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in our Prayers, ſome love to the truth, and ſome holy zeal to the true worſhip and ſervice of God: we ſhal delight in his Law, we ſhal ſtudy to do good works, and it will be the deſire of our hearts, and the comfort of our ſouls to Meditate day and night in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God.</p>
               <p>If theſe Operations of the holy Ghoſt, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to theſe two pillars, cannot eaſily work upon us, if theſe cannot raiſe up our affections to heavenly contemplations; and to be forward and ready to every good duty in the ſervice of God; then ſurely we are exceeding dull and ſtupid, and we have great need to pray earneſtly, that the holy Ghoſt will be pleaſed to come with his unreſiſtible power, and break our hard &amp; ſtony hearts and molifie this extreme obduracy that is in them with his ſuppling grace, that ſo we may more eaſily take the impreſſion of his ſanctifying grace in us.</p>
               <p>Conſider further, that theſe two pillars which did lead the Iſraelites out of Egypt, were a viſible ſign of the preſence of God with them, to conduct them in the way to Canaan, to protect and defend them from all their enemies, and to deliver them out of all dangers. And they were in the form of pillars to be a clear evidence to them, that the Lord would not leave them, nor forſake them; but would conſtantly abide with them, until he had brought them paſt all danger, and had delivered them out of all their troubles, and until he had given them reſt from all their enemies. <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 12.</note> Thus the Angel of the Lord delivered Peter out of priſon, and would not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118343:26"/> leave him untill he had brought him paſt the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ward, and through the iron gate into the city, where he might ſecure himſelf from <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſought his life.</p>
               <p>Theſe pillars were alſo a witneſſe to them of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe which God made to their Fathers, that he would give them the land of Canaan for their inheritance, and that the people ſhould alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the glory of God, their miraculous deliverance out of Egypt, and the wonderfull goodneſſe of God to them all the time they travelled through the vaſt wilderneſſe: for they had ſtill a pillar to conduct them, and God would have a memoriall kept of all his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works. Thus <note n="w" place="margin">Joſh. 24</note> the Lord commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to take twelve ſtones out of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and to leave them in the place where they ſhould lodge that night, to be a perpetuall memoriall that the waters of <hi>Jerdan</hi> were out off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it paſſed over <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time <note n="x" place="margin">Neh. 9. 12, 19.</note> the Levites in their confeſſion of Gods goodneſſe, do remember how God brought his people out of Egypt, &amp; led them by thoſe two pillars; &amp; though they did highly provoke God by their molten calfe, yet he forſook them not in the wilderneſſe: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pillar of fire by night <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Lots</hi> wife became a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ſalt, becauſe againſt Gods commandement ſhe looked back toward <hi>Sodom,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Luk. 17. 32</note> which great judgement Chriſt would have to be perpetually remembred. <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 31. 45, 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſet up a ſtone for a Pillar, as a memoriall of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to <hi>Laban,</hi> and for a witneſſe of the Covenant that was between them. Alſo, <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 35. 20</note> he ſet a pillar upon <hi>Rachels</hi> grave for a perpetual memorial of her. <note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> reared up for himſelf a pillar in the Kings dale for the perpetuity of his name: for he ſaid, I have no ſon to keep my name in remembrance, and therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pillar after his own name.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:118343:27"/>
               <p>If we do well ruminate upon theſe things, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print them in our hearts, it will make much for our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual conſolation: for where the holy Ghoſt doth ſettle his abode, it is to abide there for ever; and if we enjoy his bleſſed preſence, it is the greateſt comfort of our ſouls. He will be as a ſtrong Pillar for us to reſt upon, when we are aſſaulted with ſtrong temptations, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with perills and dangers, or any way viſited with ſorrowes and afflictions: he is alſo ſuch a Pillar of true comfort, as will not leave us in any ſad condition, or miſery, but will ſtill continue with us, untill he hath brought us out of all our troubles, dangers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>This ſimilitude of a Pillar doth ſo ſtrengthen our faith and hope in God, that nothing ſhall be able to overthrow the foundation of it. This is alſo great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, that we have the Spirit of truth to bear witneſs to our ſpirits, that we are in the love and favour of God, though the outward man be miſerably afflicted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and tormented.</p>
               <p>This conſideration will appeaſe the clamours of our ſins, and the accuſations of our conſciences; and though we are in our own apprehenſion, as quite forſaken of God, yet we ſhall hereby be preſerved from ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great a preſſure of temptation; and though the devill doth aggravate our ſins to make us caſt off all hope of pardon; yet this bleſſed Spirit will make us look up to Chriſt by faith, as he was upon the croſſe, and we ſhall ſee the guilt of all our ſins nailed to the ſame croſſe, and the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, which will fruſtrate the malicious deſigne of the devill againſt the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we may find profitable matter for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification: for it doth teach us to reſt firmly upon the aid and aſſiſtance of this bleſſed Spirit in all conditions of life, and in all the calamities and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations that we ſhall meet with in this preſent world.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118343:27"/>
               <p>It doth alſo binde us to a thankfull remembrance of all the benefites which we have received from him, of all the heavenly endowments which he hath beſtowed upon us, and of all the ſpirituall graces, which he hath wrought in us, that we may imploy them to the glory of God, and to the good of our own ſouls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought not to grieve the Holy Ghoſt, nor quench his gracious motions, but to yield all willing and ready obedience to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This doth alſo teach us to reſt upon the promiſes of God, both for proviſion, for ſuccour in time of need, and for the ſalvation of our ſouls: for he that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is faithfull and true, and if we wait his appointed time, he will aſſuredly perform it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt mark and obſerve what ſpeciall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the holy Ghoſt we have found in our hearts, either for the illumination of our underſtandings in heavenly things, or working our perverſe wills to the will of God, or ſanctifying of our affections to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, that we may glorifie God by our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for them.</p>

               <p>The holy Ghoſt doth alſo ſeal the New Covenant, and all the gracious promiſes of the Goſpel to our hearts by faith: <note n="k" place="margin">Joh. 3. 33.</note> and if we receive his teſtimony, we do ſet to our ſeal that God is true. Why then do we not reſt upon them? why is our faith ſhaken with every guſt of temptation, and with every little trouble that cometh nere us? Are we ſo weak in faith, that every blaſt of affliction ſhall blow us down? Why are we ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our ſalvation, that we are ready to let go our hold on Chriſt, when we look upon our dayly ſlips and failings that are cauſed by the ſubtility of the devill, by the inchantments of the world, and by the allurements of our carnall luſts? We do not conſider that we are ſealed with the holy Ghoſt unto the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And when we ſuffer afflictions or tribulations, we do not conſider that they ſhal not hurt us: for we have the ſeal of God in our foreheads, and he wil ſanctifie all our ſorrowes for our good: whereas to the wicked they are the beginnings of thoſe eternall torments which they ſhal ſuffer hereafter for ever.</p>
               <p>Here we may find ſweet conſolation in all conditions of life: for if we are loath to leave this world, and thoſe poſſeſſions which we do here enjoy, let our hearts and mindes be raiſed up to meditate upon that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and thoſe poſſeſſions which Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us by his blood, which we ſhal enjoy in heaven: for we have the ſeal of the holy Ghoſt for the truth of it, and then we ſhal be willing to leave theſe vain and earthly riches, and we ſhal earneſtly deſire to enjoy thoſe heavenly and durable treaſures which are there laid up for us.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118343:28"/>
               <p>If the foundation of our faith be ſhaken, this ſeal of the holy Ghoſt will ſettle it ſure; The Lord knoweth them that are his. The Covenant of Grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by this ſeal, and we may faithfully reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: for all the promiſes of God therein contained ſhall be performed in their ſeaſon. Our ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, our croſſes and tribulations, and death it ſelf cannot hurt us; becauſe we have this ſeal of the holy Ghoſt: for he will take away the print of the devils ſeal, which by nature is upon our hearts, and wil ſtamp his own image in the room. <note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 9. 4. 5</note> But thoſe men that have not the ſeal of God in their foreheads, lye open to all the judgements of God, to be tormented as with the torment of a Scorpion, when he ſtriketh a man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt is reſembled to winde, for when he hath any great work to do in us, he will come with power to rectifie our ſtubborn wils, our obdurate hearts, and rebellious affections; he will come like a ruſhing winde, to make us quake and tremble before him, and to beat down all the ſtrong holds of ſin, that our hearts may be prepared to receive him, and that he may freely work his own work in us.</p>
               <p>Thus he came upon the Apoſtles <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 2. 2, 3</note> with a ſound from heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty winde, and filled all the houſe where they were ſitting; and then he gave them the gift of tongues, to ſpeak the language of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whither he ſhould ſend them, and he gave them all ſpirituall graces, and abilities fit for that Office and function whereunto he had called them.</p>
               <p>Secondly he is reſembled to wind, becauſe his Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are free to himſelf, and he is no way neceſſitated in his workings, for he worketh in every one when and how he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">John 8. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſteth; and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the ſpirit.</hi>

So likewiſe <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> the holy Ghoſt beſtoweth his gifts diverſly, ſome have one gift, ſome another, ſome have more, and ſome have leſſe; none but Chriſt had a fulneſſe of all gifts, and <note n="t" place="margin">John 1. 16</note> of his fulneſſe have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>
               <p>As there is great diverſity in the gifts, <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 6.</note> ſo there is as great in the operations of the holy Ghoſt, and yet all proceed from the ſame Spirit: for God worketh all in all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the holy Ghoſt is reſembled to winde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth blow away the chaff and vanity of our ſinfull inventions, and idle cogitations, that our mindes may be the better fitted and prepared for heavenly contemplations, and for the worſhip and ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>Now to bring all this home in particular to thy ſelf, conſider what comforts and benefites thou doſt enjoy by the holy Ghoſt, both as he is the true comforter, whom Chriſt ſent down from the Father to abide with thee for ever, and alſo by his holy operations according to thoſe ſeverall reſemblances, and then thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him will be comfortable to thy ſoul.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:118343:29"/>
               <p>He will be a carefull Father to provide for thee, he will be a wall of defence round about thee, he will dull the ſenſe of all thy pains and torments, that thou maieſt the better bear them, as he did to the three children in the fiery furnace, and to ſome of the holy Martyrs in their torments.</p>
               <p>Though thy ſufferings are above humane ſtrength; yet he will give thee ſtrength of grace to bear them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly: for he will raiſe up thy heart <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 11 20</note> to look to the recompenſe of reward, which God will give thee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his own free love, bounty and goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if the croſſe lieth long upon thee, and thou canſt not get it removed by thy earneſt ſupplications; yet thou needeſt not be out of hope: for the heavenly comforts of the holy Ghoſt will never fail thee, but will ſtill bear thee up, againſt all the boyſterous billowes of temptations and ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>Though thy whole life be a life of miſery; yet the end ſhall be comfortable to thee, according to this of <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Pſ 37. 35, 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. But though the wicked are in great power, ſpreading themſelves like a green bay tree; yet they ſhall be deſtroyed together, and their end ſhall be cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have theſe benefits and comforts, and much more by the operations of the holy Ghoſt, we muſt then ſtudy how to be thankfull to him for his goodneſſe and how to expreſſe it by our conformity to his will, and by our ready obedience to his holy motions. Alſo, we muſt have recourſe unto him by fervent prayer for what we want, as it may ſtand with his good pleaſure to grant.</p>
               <p>But we muſt take heed with what heart and with what affections we make our addreſſes unto him: for if there be any ſecret or darling ſin lurking in us, he will eaſily find it out, he can ſearch into the moſt ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our hearts, and nothing can be hidden from his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118343:30"/> all ſeeing eye. If our hearts are more ſet upon carnall pleaſures or worldly profits, than to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on his gracious operations, and how to enjoy him, he will ſoon diſcover our hypocriſie, and it will ſtop the current of his graces to our hearts; but if he findeth truth and ſincerity in our inward parts, he will then plentifully beſtow his heavenly gifts and graces upon us: for he will give us more meekneſſe of ſpirit, more patience in our troubles, more comfort in our ſorrowes, and more grace to cleanſe and purge away the leproſie and filth of our ſins.</p>
               <p>Alſo he will put our hard and ſtony hearts into a gracious condition, fit to receive the print of his own image to ſeal unto us the aſſurance of our ſalvation. No duty then in the ſervice of God can be hard to us, if we are guided by this eternall Spirit, and nothing that we ſuffer can be bitter to our ſouls, if this heavenly comforter hath made his abode in our hearts.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place we muſt conſider, that no ſaving and ſanctifying grace can be wrought in us, but by the holy Ghoſt, and we can diſcern nothing of the deep things of God for our comfort, if we have not a ſpirituall light from him: he worketh faith in us to unite us to Chriſt, and to make application to our ſelves of the merit of his ſufferings for our redemption: he works repentance to aſſure us of the pardon of our ſins, and to manifeſt the power of Chriſts death and reſurrection in us, by the mortifying and killing of the power of our ſins, and by the quickening of us up unto newneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt worketh our filiall love to God, our hope in his promiſes, our Chriſtian patience in bearing the croſſe with a meek and a contented minde, our Chriſtian fortitude and courage in all our ſpirituall combates and tryalls, and our conſtancy to hold out untill we have obtained victory. He gives us the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our juſtification, the ſanctification of our lives, ability to pray unto God, and to meditate on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118343:30"/> him as we ought, and he worketh the renovation of the whole man in us.</p>
               <p>Theſe heavenly graces are as ſo many precious jewells to adorn our ſouls, that we may be all glorious within, <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 45. 13</note> like <hi>Solomons</hi> Queen, to be eſpouſed unto Chriſt: for if we be decked with theſe ornaments of grace, and cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, to cover the ſhame and the deformity of our ſins, then God will accept of our perſons, and of our offerings, and will hereafter wed us to his own Son.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when we come into the preſence of God to partake of his Divine Ordinances, or to perform any holy ſervice unto him, we muſt humbly crave the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the holy Ghoſt, to give us underſtanding hearts and ſanctified affections, and to put an holy zeal into our prayers and Meditations, that they may mount up above all earthly things, and aſcend up to the throne of grace, where they ſhall be heard and graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

                  <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 7. 30, 32, 33.</note> When <hi>Moſes</hi> perceived that God was in a flame of fire in a buſh, he trembled and durſt not behold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had put off his ſhoes from his feet; becauſe the place where he ſtood was holy ground.

               <p>Thus we ought to appear before God with fear and trembling, and to come with all due reverence into his Preſence when we perform any holy duties unto him, alſo to put off all our filthineſſe, and to put on the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, becauſe we come into an holy place, where God himſelf is preſent, who will not ſuffer any unclean thing to come near unto him.</p>

               <p>If we can thus Meditate on the holy Ghoſt, we ſhall find much ſweetneſſe and comfort in our Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Now let thy heart Meditate freely on this bleſſed Comforter with an holy devotion, and pure affections, when thou art in any ſorrowfull or afflicted condition, or when any anguiſh of ſpirit doth ſeize upon thee: for true conſolation is no where to be found, but onely in him.

               <p>Why then do we take ſo much thought for food and rayment? why do we cark and care for the things of this life? why are we ſo caſt down, if we want them? why are we ſo diſquieted, if trouble ſickneſſe or ſorrow preſſe heavy upon us? is not the life more than meat, and the body more than rayment? hath not Chriſt had experience of theſe wants, and of the croſſe, and and hath not he ſanctified them to us?</p>

               <p>But to look a little more about the Works of God: if we conſider the wonders that are in the ſea, where the great Leviathan doth ſport himſelf; and the coſtly and precious mineralls that are in the earth, which God hath created for the uſe of man; we ſhall ſee Gods ſtamp upon every creature, which giveth us juſt occaſion to imploy our pious thoughts, and the affections of our hearts in the Meditation of his wonderfull works, and how to praiſe him for his goodneſſe, and cheerfully to ſerve him in true thankfulneſſe for all his benefits to us.</p>
               <p>We muſt not therfore be more ignorant and dul of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than the beaſts; we muſt not be like the <hi>Jewes,</hi> of whom God complaineth thus by his Prophet. <note n="t" place="margin">Iſa. 1. 3.</note>

               <p>Wherefore let our hearts be now enlarged in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Works of God, that we may Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his praiſe and glory for the comfort of our ſouls.

               <p>Though God hath given us the uſe of all his creatures here below, and power to diſpoſe of them at our own pleaſure, ſo that it be for his glory; yet we know not how long we ſhall enjoy them: for God onely is the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>God hath given us no more time but the very moment that is preſent; for if it be paſt, we cannot recall it; if it be not yet come, we know not whether we ſhall enjoy it, when one moment is paſt, it is at Gods pleaſure to give us another.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:118343:34"/>
               <p>Wherefore every day and every night that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy from God, ſhould be ſpent to that end, for which God hath ordained them, which is, that his holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice be principally regarded, that our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling be carefully followed in their due ſeaſons, which we may take for the glory of God, either by our Meditations in his Word, or on his Works, or by ſome pious duties, as God ſhall give us fit opportunity. For God did not create the day for works of ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but for Works of piety and holineſſe: neither did he give us the uſe of the day to ſpend it vainly, idly, or unprofitably; but to be ſpent about that which doth conduce to his honour and glory, and to the good of our own ſouls.</p>
               <p>Alſo, God did not create the night to be ſpent in works of darkneſſe, neither did he give us the uſe of the night for luxurious pleaſures; but to weep and mourn for our ſins, <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 6.</note> as <hi>David</hi> did, and for holy Meditations; alſo, to refreſh our bodies and ſpirits when they are wearied with the labours of the day before, to make us the more fit for the duties following.</p>
               <p>If we thus ſpend our time, it will keep us from ſin in the day, and from uncleanneſſe in the night. Thus God doth teach us highly to prize our time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to the beſt advantage of his honour, <note n="x" place="margin">Phil. 2. 12</note> and to the working out of our own ſalvation with fear and trembling. So likewiſe, <note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 5. 16.</note> we ought to redeem the time that we have loſt; becauſe the dayes are evill; and that muſt be by doubling our future obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>Thus we may enrich our ſouls in the knowledge of God, if we do devoutly Meditate on him, and upon the creatures which he hath made.</p>
               <p>We have ſhewed in generall, how God provideth what is fitting for all living creatures, we come now to ſhew ſome ſpeciall works of Divine Providence to the Saints and Servants of God, when they are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118343:34"/> ſuch ſtraits, that they know not what to do, nor which way to turn themſelves for ſafety. If we have means to eſcape the danger, or to be delivered out of it, and we do neglect it; we have then no ground to hope for ſafety, or deliverance by the Providence of God, becauſe we bring our ſelves into the danger: but if we have no means to eſcape, and no way to be delivered out of any dangerous ſtrait, we may then caſt our ſelves upon the Providence of God, and he will make a way for us to eſcape; becauſe he hath brought us into this ſtrait, to manifeſt his own work of Providence for his own glory, and for our ſafety.</p>

               <p>Sometimes God ſuffers the devill and wicked men to lay their traps to enſnare his own ſervants, if he ſeeth them ſecure and careleſſe of their wayes, and though they do maliciouſly intend and purpoſe their hurt and<note place="margin">

               <p>If we thus wait upon God, <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 30. 18</note> then the Lord will wait that he may be gracious unto us, and therefore we ought to wait for him.

               </p>
               <p>The glorious creatures in heaven are comfortable to us by our intereſt in Chriſt, and all creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are for our uſe, and at our command, and ſervice, becauſe we have right to them by faith in Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we can have no comfort in them, and no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that they belong unto us. If our faith be well rooted, it will then be fruitfull in all good works, and it will never decay, becauſe it doth ſpring from a Divine
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118343:36"/> Principle, and is continually watered with a ſpirituall dew from heaven. Alſo, there is great need that it be well grounded and built upon a ſure rock, becauſe we ſhall meet with ſtrong aſſaults and temptations, which like boyſterous windes and billowes, will ſeek to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, and we cannot comfortably injoy the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, if we do not injoy them in Chriſt our Saviour, which muſt be onely by faith in him.</p>
               <p>God himſelf will ſometimes try our faith, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by afflictions and croſſes, by ſuffering our enemies and wicked men to vex our very ſouls, or by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſiſting grace from us, by clouding the light of his countenance, or by deferring the manifeſtation of his Divine Providence, when we are in any ſtrait, or in any neceſſity, which we could not ſhun, and cannot tell which way to turn our ſelves, becauſe we have no means of help, comfort, and ſalvation, but onely to caſt our ſelves upon the Providence of God, which we cannot comfortably do, if our faith be not well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt the rock of our ſalvation. For if it be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any ſandy foundation, as upon our naturall endowments, upon common grace, or upon any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it will fall at every guſt of temptation, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wave of affliction, and it will not endure the fiery tryall; it doth reſt more upon the arm of fleſh than it doth upon God, and it ſeeks rather to ſecondary means for help and ſuccour, than it doth unto God, and in the end it will deceive us.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place God is wonderfull in his works of juſtice, and in his Works of mercy, both to the juſt and and to the unjuſt; but in a farre differing manner to them both, and to a farre-differing end. For God will not ſuffer ſin to be unpuniſhed, whereſoever he findeth it. If his own children offend, he will chaſtiſe them with a fatherly correction in much love and tender compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to bring them to better obedience; but his loving kindneſſe he will not take from them, according
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118343:36"/> as he ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If thy ſon commit iniquity, I will chaſtiſe him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men: but my mercy ſhall not depart away from him.</hi> But God puniſheth the ſins of the wicked in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and with much ſeverity for their deſtruction: his own children are reformed by their corrections, but the wicked are more hardned in their ſins by their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This of the Prophet is verified in them: <note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, thou haſt stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God doth alſo beſtow his mercies and bleſſings upon them both; he doth commonly give more of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings to the wicked than he doth to the godly, to leave them without excuſe, and to give them means and ability to glorifie God, but they abuſe them to ſin and uncleanneſſe, to exceſſe and riot. <note n="o" place="margin">Eccl. 5. 13</note> This is that evill which the Preacher did ſee under the ſun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</p>
               <p>But God hath ſpeciall gifts and bleſſings which he beſtoweth onely upon the godly, and theſe are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſanctifying graces of his Spirit, which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar onely to them, and reſerved for them.</p>

               <p>VVherefore if we are elected unto ſalvation, and do belong unto Chriſt by the Election of grace, the holy Ghoſt will at ſome time or other work ſanctifying grace in us, and will unite us unto Chriſt by faith, that ſo we may have a modeſt and ſober aſſurance of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by him, and of our reconcilement into the love and favour of God. Why then do we not ſeek to be ingrafted into Chriſt for our Redemption? Why do we continue ſtill in a voluntary captivity and bondage, whereas we may be ſet at liberty? Why are we ſtill exiles and baniſhed from the preſence of God, whereas we may be brought again into his favour? Why do we not ſeek hs face and the light of his countenance, ſeing all true felicity and happineſſe conſiſteth therein, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſa. 16. 11</note> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore? and why are we ſo backward in ſeeing the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Alas, we have not a true ſenſe of our own miſerable ſlavery, we do not feel the burden of our ſins, we do not ſee how the devill doth tyrannize over us, how he doth beguil us with a ſeeming pleaſure and profit in ſin: for he will not let us ſee the greatneſſe of the loſſe that we ſuſtain by it, nor the bitterneſſe of the torments that will follow after it, beſide thoſe temporall ſorrows that it bringeth upon us in this life.</p>
               <p>Thus the devill bringeth us into ſecurity, and into a dead ſleep of ſin, and doth ſo ſtupifie all the faculties of our ſouls, that we have no ſenſe of our ſpirituall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and by this means he leadeth us into a dangerous way, that tendeth to no other end but to the perdition

Alſo we are ſo delighted with the vanities of this world, that we think of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happineſſe, than what we do now injoy: or if there be any other heaven, than this upon earth, we will be directed to it by the guidance of our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted will, and not by the Spirit of God: for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill would perſwade us that nature can finde out a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and an eaſier way to heavenly felicity, than by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus we are hindred, and kept back by the deluſions of the devill by the alluring vanities of the world, and by the deceitfulneſſe of our own hearts, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come unto Chriſt for our Redemption, and to make our peace with God through faith in him, and to have an holy aſſurance of it by our ſound and true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</p>
               <p>Wherefore it doth now plainly appear that we have no power or ability in our ſelves to come unto Chriſt; we muſt be taught of God, or elſe we cannot find the way, he muſt draw us, or elſe we cannot come to Chriſt: For thus ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <note n="t" place="margin">John 6. 44</note> 
                  <hi>No man can come unto me except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> God doth ſometimes draw us unto Chriſt, <note n="u" place="margin">Hoſ: 11. 4</note> as he drew <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, with cords of a man, with bands of love:</hi> he will give us a Spirituall light by his Spirit to finde the way, he will kindle an holy zeal in our hearts and affections to walk in it, and he will inflame our deſires, that by grace we may come to Chriſt our Redeemer. <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24</note> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God doth bring us unto Chriſt by the Law, as our Schoolmaſter with a rod in his hand, by terrifying us with the threatenings of the Law; if that be not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, then he will make us feel the ſmart of his rod by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, croſſes, and tribulations.</p>
               <p>God doth alſo ſend his Miniſters, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor 5. 20</note> as his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, that by the Preaching of the Goſpel they might win us unto Chriſt, and to be reconciled unto God. Chriſt doth alſo ſweetly draw us unto himſelf, as the

               <p>Thus ſaith the Spouſe to her beloved, <note n="y" place="margin">Cant. 1. 3</note> 
                  <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Chriſt doth alſo lovingly invite us to come unto him, and to make us the more willing to come, he doth allure us by his gracious promiſes: <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 11. 28</note>

Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear and your ſoul ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How could Chriſt expreſſe his love more freely to a poor ſinfull ſoul, than now he doth? what will move us to come unto him, if this free tender of grace cannot? But to the end we may be quite without excuſe, and that the love of God may abundantly appear unto us, the holy Ghoſt doth likewiſe draw us unto Chriſt, by giving us a true ſight and ſenſe of our ſins, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the means how we may be freed from the guilt, and from the condemning power of ſin, by working faith in us to apply to our ſelves the merits of Chriſts blood, and his righteouſneſſe for our juſtification, and by working us into newneſſe of life by the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>It doth now plainly and evidently appear, that our ſins have ſet us at a farre diſtance from God, according to this of the Prophet, <note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 59. 2.</note>

               <p>Though Chriſt by his death and reſurrection hath perfectly wrought our redemption from all our ſpirituall enemies, yet we have not the full vertue and power of it in this life: for we are often foiled with the temptations and ſuggeſtions of the devill, our ſins do prevail againſt us, our ſinfull luſts and unruly paſſions do often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us, <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7. 19, 20, 23.</note>

               <p>Here is matter of great comfort, if our hearts do pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ruminate upon the tranſcendent love of God to us in our Redemption. <note n="g" place="margin">John 3. 16</note>

                  <hi>Adam</hi> had but a dimme light of his Redemption; yet it was ſufficient to ground his faith upon it, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace was very myſtically delivered to him, but the Patriarks and Prophets had a clearer evidence of it: God hath given us a full demonſtration of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, becauſe Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the whole work of our Salvation, by treading down all principalities and powers under his feet, and by ſubduing to us all the enemies of our ſalvation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death is our laſt enemy, which will undoubtedly ſeize upon our bodies, we do aſſuredly believe, that by the power of Chriſts Reſurrection, who is our head, our bodies ſhall be raiſed up out of the duſt at the laſt day: for Chriſt hath redeemed our bodies from death, as well as our ſouls from the devill, that both in ſoul and in body we may live and reign with Chriſt for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

               <p>Now let our hearts and ſouls devoutly Meditate upon the great Work of our Redemption: for it was far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Creation of the whole world; God did but ſay the Word let ſuch a thing be made, and it was made: he did not diſrobe himſelf of any part of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the creation of any creature, but rather his glory, wiſdom and power was magnified in the making of the leaſt of them.

To ſome he giveth more time, and to ſome leſſe, and all muſt imploy it to the glory of God, and to the good of his neighbour. God doth meaſure out our life by time, and ſome have a longer meaſure than others, and this meaſure is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us by moments: for we cannot recall the time that is paſt, and we do not injoy the time that is to come; ſo that we have onely the time that is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is but a moment, and when one moment of time is gone, God doth give us another, until the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time, that God hath allotted us, be fulfilled. If we look upon an hour-glaſſe, we ſhall ſee how ſwiftly one grain of ſand runneth after another, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth untill all be run out.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with the moments of our life, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118343:47"/> followeth ſwiftly after another, which God would have us duly to conſider, that we may not waſte our time in vain things, but imploy it to that end for which God gave it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is, to the working out of our own ſalvation, that God may be honoured and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thereby; and therefore about whatſoever we ſpend our time, if it doth not conduce to that end, it is but loſt and vainly ſpent.</p>
               <p>God hath given us a time for all our neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions here upon earth, that all things may be done in their ſeaſon: For as the Preacher ſaith, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>

               <p>We are wiſe enough to know our times for earthly things; but we have no care to obſerve the times of grace, how and when we may gain the grace and favour of God, that he may accept of our perſons, and of our holy oblations that we offer unto him; and alſo when we may obtain from him the ſaving and ſanctifying graces of his moſt bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>The time of our life is the generall and longeſt time of grace, that God hath given us, wherein we ſhould ſeek his gracious acceptance of us in Chriſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118343:48"/> he doth work grace in the hearts of all his Elect by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now if we meaſure this time of grace by the length of our dayes, acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Are we not dayly ſubject to caſualities, and to ſudden death? if we be ſtrong and have our health to day, we may be weak and ſick to morrow; though we dream of long life; yet it is but a dream, for we have no aſſurance of it.</p>
               <p>If we thus meaſure the time of grace, we ſhall put it off with delayes, untill God doth ſuddenly bereave us of all time. But we muſt meaſure out our dayes by the Rule of Gods Word. and then we ſhall ſee, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 47 9</note> 
                  <hi>that our dayes are few and evill;</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and holy <hi>David</hi> will tell us, <note n="e" place="margin">Pſa. 144. 4.</note> that <hi>man is like to vanity, his dayes are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away:</hi> alſo, <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note> that <hi>our dayes are as an hand-breadth, and our age is as nothing before God:</hi> And in another Pſalm, he ſaith thus: <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 103. 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>As for man, his dayes are as graſſe: as a flower of the field ſo he flowriſheth: for the winde paſſeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof ſhall know it no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſaith holy <hi>Job,</hi>

                  <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhuttle, and are ſpent without hope. O remember that my life is winde.</hi> If our life be winde, how ſoon then is it gone? how little then is the time of grace? and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this little moment dependeth our eternall happineſs: for when this life is ended, there is no more time for grace, or to ſeek the favour of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is extream folly to loſe any part of this precious time without ſome gain of grace,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to ſpend it to any other end than to the glory of God: then much more, to waſte it in ſinfull pleaſures, to the great diſhonour of his Name, and to the deſtruction and loſſe of our own ſouls.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:118343:48"/>
               <p>Though we be in the State of Grace; yet through the corruption of our nature, and the frailty of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, we are ſubject to many ſlips and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſometimes we do ſo dangerouſly fall, that God will hide his face from us, and eclipſe the bright beames of his gracious countenance for a time; ſo that we ſhall have no ſenſe nor apprehenſion of his Grace and favour to us, and the fruits of his Spirit will ſeem to us to be withered and dryed up.</p>
               <p>But God hath his ſpeciall times of grace, when he will be found of us, and when he will graciouſly accept us, and will manifeſt again the fruits of his holy Spirit, and his ſanctifying graces ſhall again ſhine forth in us, when God hath wrought his own work in our hearts, and hath humbled us for our ſins with his rod, he will then call to us, ſaying, <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 27. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> and our hearts muſt preſently anſwer with <hi>David, Thy face Lord will we ſeek:</hi> for to anſwer preſently to Gods call is the time of gracious acceptation, thus ſaith <hi>David, I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I ſaid</hi>

                     </gap>r that appeareth for a little time and then vaniſheth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now plain and evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the principall time of grace is, when God is pleaſed to offer it, and when he doth give us the means to attain unto it: for God keeps the gift of grace in his own power, to give it to whom, and when he pleaſeth, and except God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, we cannot receive it. The very firſt deſires of ſeeking grace is Gods free offer of it to us: for he doth incline the will, and works thoſe holy deſires in our hearts by the operation of his own Spirit. Sometimes the holy Ghoſt doth work them in us upon the true ſight and ſenſe of our ſins, and thereby moves us to make our peace with God by true repentance, according to this of the Prophet. <note n="o" place="margin">Iſa. 55. 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt doth alſo work thus in our hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſenſe of our wants and neceſſities, and upon the ſenſe of our afflictions and tribulations, to humble our ſouls before God, that our hearts may be prepared to ſeek his love and favour, by fervent prayer. Thus ſaith the Prophet, <note n="p" place="margin">Iſa. 26. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer, when thy chaſtening was upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we do duly conſider theſe thiogs, and ponder well upon them in our hearts, it will teach us highly to prize that time which God doth lend us here in this life for the gain of Grace, that hereafter we may attain to eternall happineſſe in the kingdom of heaven: alſo not to refuſe any offer of Grace that God ſhall make unto us: Firſt, becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r time is ſhort and momentany, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118343:49"/> we know not how long we ſhall enjoy it. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our little time is tranſitory, and paſſeth ſwiftly away, and we cannot recall one moment that is gone. Thirdly, becauſe it is the time which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Grace, and the time of his gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Fourthly, becauſe the eternall ſalvation both of our ſouls and bodies dependeth upon this ſhort time of our life. Laſtly, if we loſe any opportunity of grace that God doth give us, we ſhew great unthankfulneſſe to God, and we know not whether he will give us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity for it. Wherefore we ſhould not ſpend our time idly, or unprofitably; but we muſt with all care and diligence improve it to thoſe ends for which God hath given it, to make our calling and election ſure by faith in Chriſt, to make our peace with God, whom we have offended, and to regain his love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, when we have loſt the apprehenſion of it by our ſins.</p>
               <p>Many heavenly comforts we ſhall finde, if we liſten to Gods call, and receive Grace when he doth offer it. Firſt, God will be found of us, if we ſeek him with pure affections, and in the uprightneſſe of our hearts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he will hear our ſupplications and prayers, if they proceed from a true ſenſe of the want of what we pray for. Thirdly, he will ſuccour and comfort us in our ſorrowes and diſtreſſes, if we cry unto him in the true apprehenſion of our own miſery. Laſtly, ſuch is the goodneſſe of God, that he will incline our will, and put holy deſires into our hearts, to ſeek the light of his countenance, when we are prepared for it by true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and ſorrow for our ſins: for then he will hear our prayers, he will grant our requeſts, and will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accept us; though our ſins had formerly moved him to hide himſelf from us.</p>
               <p>Conſider further, that the principall meanes of grace is by Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, by whoſe righteouſneſſe we are juſtified, by whoſe grace we are ſanctified, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118343:50"/> by the merite of whoſe blood we are ſaved: ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt we can neither come into grace and favour with God, neither can any ſanctifying and ſaving graces be wrought in us to make us capable of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now God hath appointed the ſincere Preaching of his Word to be a ſpecial meanes to reveal Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and fully to us, and to work faith in us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are knit and united unto Chriſt, from whom all other ſanctifying and heavenly graces do plentifully flow, and they are conveyed to us by the operations of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God;</hi> and it bringeth in with it all other ſpirituall Graces. For the Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it whatſoever is needful to ſalvation, and there is no grace but we may attain to it by this meanes, if the holy Ghoſt doth accompany the adminiſtration of it to bring it cloſe to our hearts.</p>
               <p>God hath alſo other meanes, which he uſeth for the working of grace in us, and to bring us home when we go aſtray from him: for every bleſſing that we receive, every affliction that he ſendeth, and every motion of his Spirit that we feel, is a call from God, and a meanes that conduceth to the gain of ſome grace or other. His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſhould ſtir us up to glorifie God with our praiſes and thankfulneſſe: <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> his goodneſſe ſhould lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and his love to us, ſhould binde us to love him again: alſo, the ſorrowes and miſeries that we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in this life ſhould teach us godly ſorrow for our ſins, and patience under the croſſe, they ſhould humble us, and bring us to true repentance, and newneſſe of life: ſo likewiſe every motion of his holy Spirit ſhould move us to obedience, and to conformity of will to the will of God; and the dayly experience we have of Gods care over us, ſhould teach us to confide in God, and to reſt and depend upon him in all conditions of life whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:118343:50"/>
               <p>Theſe and the like means God doth uſe to quicken up thoſe graces that lye languiſhing in us, and are as dead to our apprehenſion; and alſo to make us ſeek unto him for his grace and favour, which is ſufficient to ſupport us in all our tryalls and diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe heavenly motions of the holy Ghoſt is Gods ſtill voice, which ſhould make deep impreſſion in our hearts, becauſe he doth thereby immediatly from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reveal his will and pleaſure to us, what we ought to do; to which holy inſpirations we ought to yield our willing obedience, though it be irkſome to our nature, and croſſing the unregenerate part of our will, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to leave a darling ſin, which we have long nouriſhed in our boſomes This is a time when we may gain the grace and favour of God, if we are ready to liſten to this voice, and cheerfully to obey it Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ought to be our care, to imbrace any meanes, or opportunity that God ſhall tender to us for grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Gods time of grace, and he will ſecond his own time and his own meanes with a bleſſing, if we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; but if we will be feaſting, when we ſhould faſt and pray, or rejoicing when we ſhould mourn and weep, we do then diſcover too much diſobedience, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the will of God.</p>
               <p>Now we ought to examine our ſelves how we have profited under the meanes of grace, how the Word of God hath wrought upon our hearts and affections, what heavenly graces have been wrought in us by it, or by any of Gods holy Ordinances, and what ſpirituall comfort we have found by them. Alſo, we ought to examine what thankfulneſſe we have returned to God for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, what ſorrow of heart we have had for our ſins, how we have been humbled under the croſſe, what reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life Grace hath wrought in us, how we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the holy motions of Gods Spirit, and how we have been raviſhed in ſoul with earneſt deſires to do the will of God.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:118343:51"/>
               <p>If we have lived long under a powerfull Miniſtery, and yet have gained little or no knowledge of Chriſt, and of the truth, and no faith or ſaving grace is wrought in us by the power of it, we have then loſt ſo much time of grace, and we have not improved the meanes of grace to our beſt advantage, nor to the right end as God hath appointed, which is to gain grace for the ſpiritual good of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let theſe be the Meditations of our hearts, how to improve the time and the meanes of Grace to the right end, that we may be found good ſtewards, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants to our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, by that gain which we ſhall make of grace in this little ſtock of time which he hath given us in this life. For the more time, and the more meanes of grace we do enjoy, the more fruits of grace we muſt bring forth, or elſe we ſhall be unprofitable ſervants. If we improve our time for grace, as we ought, we ſhall gain the love and favour of God in Chriſt, our hearts will be ſeaſoned with all ſpirituall graces, and our converſation will be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while we live here upon earth: for we ſhall live a gracious and a comfortable life now, and a glorious and bleſſed life hereafter. Alſo, let this be the true deſire of our ſouls, to redeem the time of grace that we have loſt, and to improve the meanes of grace to more profit, that the fruits of it may appear in our obedience to Gods Commandements, in our zeal to the true worſhip and ſervice of God, and in our care to walk in all piety and vertue, which we may the better do, if we daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelves to God by faithfull prayer for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit herein.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place we muſt conſider, that though God doth give us time and meanes for grace; yet we cannot attain unto it without the ſpeciall working of the Spirit of grace in us, for he muſt put a ſpirituall light into our underſtandings, he muſt open our hearts, and incline the will, or elſe we cannot receive it.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:118343:51"/>
               <p>All heavenly gifts and ſpiritual graces come from God, which the Father is ſometimes ſaid to give, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this of <hi>James,</hi>

But theſe heavenly graces are properly wrought in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, how and when he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore crave his help, we muſt wait his time, and attend upon the means, until he ſhall be pleaſed to work grace in us, and we muſt reſolve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delaies or excuſes, <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 3. 7.</note> to accept of grace, even that very day when God doth offer it, and not to grieve his good Spirit by refuſing the ſweet tender of grace, or by loſing any opportunity, wherein God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by this heavenly work of grace in us.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, <note place="margin">Pſ. 8. 4, 5.</note> be not thou like the deaf adder that ſtoppeth her ear, which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never ſo wiſely; but when any means of grace is offered, or when thou feeleſt a good motion in thy heart, be ready to imbrace it: for that is Gods call, and then Chriſt knocketh at the door of thy heart, <note n="x" place="margin">Rev. 3. 20.</note> as he did at the door of the <hi>Laodiceans:</hi> if thou doſt preſently open unto him, <hi>he will come in to thee, and will ſup with thee, and thou ſhalt ſup with him;</hi> but if thou deferreſt it until the morrow, thou knoweſt not whether he will knock again or not.</p>

               <p>Chriſt will feaſt thee at his own table with bread of life, water of life, and with heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> which are precious dainties, and ſpiritual food for thy ſoul to feed upon, and thy heart will rejoice and be glad in him.

               <p>Now if thou haſt any care of thy ſouls health, ſtudy and meditate how to obſerve the times and means of grace, and how to improve them to the glory of God, and to thine own ſpiritual gain.</p>
               <p>Canſt thou obſerve the times and ſeaſons of the year for the fruits of the earth, and haſt thou no care to take the opportunities that God gives thee for grace? learn of the marriner, who will hoyſe up ſail, when the wind ſerves for him; and when God offers thee grace, do thou raiſe up thy heart and affections to receive it. If thou refuſeſt his gracious goodneſs to thee herein, it is no wonder, if thou art barren of true vertue and piety, if thy ſoul be without ſpiritual comfort in thy ſorrows and afflictions; and it is no marvel if thou art fruitleſs in all good works.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt make the true gain of thy time, thou muſt diligently attend to the holy ordinances of God, thou muſt thankfully receive his mercies and bleſſings, thou muſt bear the Croſs of Chriſt with patience and with meekneſs, ſubmitting thy ſelf with all humbleneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the will and pleaſure of God. Alſo, thou muſt repent of holy duties omitted, as well as of ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and howſoever God ſhall deal with thee at that very time, make an holy uſe of it for the glory of God, and for the comfort of thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>If the devil hath deluded thee with falſe pretences, or hath lulled thee aſleep in his bed of ſecurity; ſo that thou haſt ſlighted the means of grace, and haſt vainly ſpent thy precious time without any ſpiritual or heavenly

               <p>To conclude, if thou doſt deſire to make the true gain of the time of grace, thou muſt ſtrive to remove out of thy heart whatſoever doth diſpleaſe, or diſhonour God, and whatſoever may hinder the operations of the holy Ghoſt, and the current of grace to thy heart. For if thy mind is carried after the love of the world, after vain pleaſures, or ſinful delights, and if thou doſt prize any thing above grace, or love any thing more than thou loveſt Chriſt; the love of God cannot dwell in thee, and ſpiritual grace cannot be wrought in thee, until thy heart be prepared to receive it, which muſt be by the powerful working of the holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>THere is now great need, that we do ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think our ſelves, and that our hearts do faithfully meditate upon it, what danger we may incurre and run into, if we do not accept of grace when God doth offer it, if we do not come to God when he calleth, nor do what he commandeth at his own appointed time: alſo, how dangerous it is to delay our repentance, and the reformation of our ſinful lives from day to day, and to cover our delaies with this vain pretence, that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we will perform that which God commandeth, and then we will amend all that is amiſs; and thus we put off this precious time of grace, and thus we deferre our repentance for our ſins, until God, who is the ſole commander of time, doth ſhut us out of all time, to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118343:53"/> utter perdition of our poor ſoules, which he may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, if we thus abuſe the ſingular benefit of time, which God hath given us here for the gaining of his grace and favour.</p>
               <p>This is a dangerous and a cunning deceit, which the devil uſeth to bring us to deſtruction; if he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to make delaies in the work of grace, and in doing that which God commandeth: for by this means we ſhall incur the wrath and high diſpleaſure of God, we ſhall in danger our repentance, and converſion unto God, and conſequently our eternal ſalvation, The devil knoweth that one ſin will draw on another, that cuſtom will bring us to an habit of ſinning; and he that will not receive the tender of grace to day, may not have the time, or the means of it to morrow, and he that refuſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to day, may be more indiſpoſed for it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

               <p>If we continue in ſinne without repentance, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the devil is more eſtabliſhed and confirmed in us, the good inclination of our will is more weakned and perverted, the faculties of our mind are more corrupted, our underſtanding is more darkned, and our unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118343:54"/> are more ſtrengthned againſt the rule of reaſon, and harder to be repreſſed by continuance of time, than they were before.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we cannot be ſafe from the evil of thoſe ſubtle ſuggeſtions of the devil, unleſs we ſhroud our ſelves under the protection of God by prayer, and keep our ſouls cloſe unto Chriſt by faith: for then he will preſerve us from the danger of thoſe ſnares, and he will keep us, that we be not deluded with his inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to loſe the opportunities of grace, that God doth give us. For it is grace onely that doth keep us from the habit of ſin, that no ſin ſhall be rooted in us; it is the ſtrength of grace that giveth us power over our ſins, and that keeps us from the deluſions of the Devil: and therefore if God withdraws his aſſiſting grace from us, we have then no means to be preſerved from thoſe dangerous deceits of the devil, or to make the way of vertue, and of godlineſs eaſie to us.</p>
               <p>If we have been deluded by the ſubtilty of the devil, by the allurements of the world, or by the intiſements of the fleſh, to continue long in a ſinful courſe of life, and to neglect the means of grace, when it was offered, or to delay our repentance, and turning unto God, to the great hazzard of the ſalvation of our ſouls; let our heart melt into godly ſorrow for our long delaies in ſeeking the grace and favour of God, and for loſing ſo much time without the gain of ſome grace for the good of our ſouls, that God may be glorified thereby. If God ſhall make our life but like the ſhorteſt day of the year; yet we ſhall diſcover too much groſs ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to him, if we will not afford him one hour of that day for his honour and glory: then much more is our unthankfulneſs toward him, if our life be lengthned out to the longeſt day, and if we do alſo injoy the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel; and yet have no care to ſeek his face, or to gain his favour, untill the twilight of that day, when ſickneſs and infirmities will diſable us, and when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118343:54"/> old age doth ſeaze upon us. How can we expect that God will accept of our ſower winter fruits, when we deny him our ſweet and pleaſant ſummer fruits? what fruits can the ſeed of grace produce, when our hearts have been overgrown with bryers and thorns ah our whole life? can we ſpend all the oyle in our lamps in ſeeking for earthly things, and provide none to have our lamps burning, that we may attend upon the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom when he cometh? <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> The fooliſh Virgins in the Goſpel did thus, and therefore, <hi>when the bridegroom came, they were not ready, and went not in with him to the marriage, and the door was ſhut, we ſhould therefore watch, for we know neither the day, nor the hour, wherein the Son of man cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we do ſeriouſly think upon the many and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that we have already received from God, and yet we do hope for, and expect much more, even eternal happineſs hereafter; we cannot but be more careful to labour for true ſaving grace in the beſt part of our daies, without which we cannot attain to it: and not to ſpend our time vainly in ſeeking the profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, reſerving the laſt and worſt part of our lives for the ſervice of God, and for the Kingdome of heaven: for we know not whether God will then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it.</p>
               <p>If God doth give us grace then to repent (for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is abſolutely his own gift) yet we muſt then lament and bewail theſe dangerous delayes which we have made: for by how much the more we prolong our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto God, the more we increaſe our ſins, and ſo much the greater will be our pain and ſorrow in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, if it be true, and ſound: alſo, the amendment of our lives will be much the harder. Time is not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but loſt, which we ſpend without ſome fruits of grace and godlineſs, which indeed is the true gain of time: and therefore we ſhould ſeek unto God while he may be found, <note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 55. 6.</note> we ſhould call upon him while he is neer:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118343:55"/> otherwiſe, though we ſeek him, he will not be found, and though we call upon him, he will not anſwer, nor be intreated. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2</note> 
                  <hi>now is the time acceptable, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have juſt cauſe to bewail our condition: for the corruption of our nature doth ſo weaken us, and the power of our ſpiritual enemies doth ſo prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, that we cannot break through ſuch ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as they make to hinder this holy work of grace in us.</p>
               <p>I he devil doth cunningly diſſwade us from it, the world doth ſtrongly allure us to follow ſtill the vanities of it, and our own fleſh doth dayly intice us to carnal pleaſures and delights; ſo that we can finde no time to make our peace with God, or to improve the means of grace to his glory, and to our own comfort. Though we do ſometimes ſtrive againſt our ſins; yet we cannot overcome them, or if one ſinne be ſubdued, another is ready to riſe up againſt us; alſo, though we cannot actually commit a ſin; yet we may commit it in our ſinful deſires to it, in a ſinful remembrance of it, in conſenting to it, or in ſuffering it to be done, when by our place and authority we might hinder it. We have alſo juſt cauſe to bemoan our ſelves: for though we do labour for grace, and do uſe all means for it to the beſt of our power, and yet we cannot attain unto it. Though it be thus with us; yet we muſt ſtill continue our beſt endeavours to oppoſe all the enemies of our ſalvation, and we muſt ſtill uſe the means of grace, and wait upon God, until he ſhall pleaſe to work grace in us by his Spirit; alſo, we muſt pray unto him with a faithful heart, that by the omnipotent power of his grace, <hi rend="sup">e</hi> and by the rod of his ſtrength, which is the Word and Sprit, he would make us able to overcome our corruptions by ſeaſoning our hearts with grace, to ſubdue the power of our ſins by repentance, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our time to the glory of God, and alſo to break
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118343:55"/> through the ſnares of the devil, the world and the fleſh. Then God will ſo bleſs us in our pious indeavours, that we ſhall prevail againſt all oppoſition and adverſary power, not by our own ſtrength, but by the might, and power of Jeſus Chriſt our gracious Redeemer; <note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> whoſe grace and favour is ſufficient for us, and whoſe ſtrength is made perfect in our weakneſſe, under whoſe banner we fight theſe ſpiritual battels for the honour of his great name.</p>

               <p>Alſo, we muſt know how he hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God for our ſinnes, how he hath conquered death, hell, and the devil, and what price he hath paid for our ranſom: for without this heavenly knowledge and faith to apply it to our ſelves, vve can dravv no comfort to our ſouls from Chriſt, neither can vve have any good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that vve are freed from the curſe of the Lavv, that the juſtice of God is ſatisfied for our ſins, that ſin hath no condemning power over us, that the ſting of death

And though the humane nature of Chriſt was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into his Deity, whereby this union was never to be diſſolved: yet either nature had their whole proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and operations remaining ſtill unconfounded, and therefore he was true God, and true man, <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 2. 17</note> like unto us in all things, <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> ſin onely excepted, and thoſe two natures made but one perſon in Chriſt, <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 28. 18</note> to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth; ſo that he commandeth and over-ruleth al created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whatſoever.</p>
               <p>God did alſo give him three honourable offices, that he might be every way fit to be our eternal Mediatour between God and us: for God ordained him to be a Prophet to teach and inſtruct us; to be a Prieſt to make interceſſion for us, and to offer ſuch a ſacrifice to God for our ſins, as he would accept; and to be a King to rule and govern his Church, and alſo to rule in our hearts by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Chriſt being thus qualified, hath fulfilled for us and

               <p>When Chriſt did execute that part of his prieſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was the offering up of his body a ſacrifice for us, no heart can conceive, and no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the bitter torments which he ſuffered both in his ſoul, and in his body, to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, for our ſinnes, and to purchaſe our freedome and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the captivity of ſinne and Satan. <note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> He was a man of ſorrowes, he was deſpiſed, he hath born our griefs, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtizement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118343:57"/> Now then canſt thou ever put an end to thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on his abundant love to thee? canſt thou be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful to him, that he hath been ſo rich in goodneſs to thee, ſo free in his mercies, and ſo liberal in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to ſuch a worthleſs creature, as thou art? let him therefore be the chief joy of thy heart, and put thy whole confidence in him by faith for thy ſalvation: do not forget ſo great love; but cloſe with him, imbrace him with the armes of thy faith, be guided and directed by him in all thy wayes, and yield all ſubmiſſion to Chriſt thy King and Governour, to obey his Laws, and to obſerve his commands.</p>
               <p>Feed thy heart then, and refreſh thy ſoul by rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the excellencies and al-ſufficiency of Chriſt thy Saviour, with thoughts beſeeming the honour and dignity of his ſacred Perſon. For if thou thinkeſt upon him onely as he is man, thou doeſt too much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value his Highneſs, and if thou conceiveſt of him, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, thou canſt not draw then neer unto him without dread and terror, by reaſon of his glory and majeſty, and alſo by reaſon of thy pollutions and defilements. If Chriſt were onely man, he could not have ſatisfied the juſtice of an infinite God, neither had his blood been a ſufficient price for mans redemption; and if onely God, he could not have ſuffered the penalty of the Law by his death. But if thou doeſt meditate on him, and apply thy ſelf to him by a true and a lively faith; as he is thy onely Saviour, both God and man, <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> then thou maiſt come boldly to the throne of grace, where thou ſhalt receive, and find grace to help in time of need; and thy meditations of him will be exceeding comfortable to thy ſoul.

Wherefore, renounce all that is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in humane learning, and truſt not to thine own abilities, or to common grace for thy redemption: for they profit thee nothing for thy juſtification, though they may conduce much toward a well ordered and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil life: but ſtrive to get faith; and all ſanctifying grace, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt may be imputed to thee, and that thy life may be truly ſanctified, and reformed to the will of God.</p>
               <p>We muſt conſider further for our better underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt our bleſſed Redeemer, that he is ſet forth in the holy Scriptures by ſome reſemblances, which are very comfortable for us to meditate upon; becauſe they ſhew our union with him, his ſpecial care of us, and the great benefits that we ſhall have by him, if we can make an holy application of him to our ſelves by faith.

He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> If we are ingrafted by faith into this true vine, we are then ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit and united unto Chriſt, that no power, nor policy can ſeparate us from him: for <note n="o" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>we are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation:</hi> we ſhall be purged and pruned from the guilt, and from the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all our ſins, and we ſhall be dreſſed and adorned with grace and vertue, that we may bring forth much fruit in a pious life, and holy converſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is reſembled to an head: <note n="p" place="margin">Col. 1. 18.</note> for he is the head of the Church, and we are the members of that body, to be guided and directed by him, to be taught and inſtructed of him, and as the head preſerveth the natural body; <note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 5. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> ſo is Chriſt the Saviour of every
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118343:58"/> member of his myſtical body; and as all the members of the natural body draw their ſenſe and motion from the head, and are ſerviceable, and obedient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the head, as the hands to work, the feet to run, the back to bear any heavy burden, and the like; ſo do we draw all our ſenſe and motion in heavenly things from Chriſt, by reaſon of the operation of the holy Ghoſt, and we ought to yield all duty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, to do what he commandeth with all cheerfulneſs of ſpirit, and willingly to bear his Croſs, though the burden be very heavy to our weak nature. This will give us great aſſurance, that we have a neer relation unto Chriſt, if we find this readineſs of will in our ſelves, to ſubmit to his moſt bleſſed and holy will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is called <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 13. 20</note> 
                  <hi>that great ſhepheard of the ſheep,</hi> and thus he ſaith of himſelf, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 11, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and I know my ſheep, and am known of mine: the good ſhepheard giveth his life for the ſheep.</hi> The Prophet telleth us from the Lords own mouth, that it is the property of a good ſhepheard <note n="t" place="margin">Ezec. 34. 3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>to feed the flock, to ſtrengthen the diſeaſed, to heal the ſick, to bind up that which is brok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, to bring again that which is driven away, to ſeek that which is loſt, and to protect his flock from the danger of the wolf. Iſaiah</hi> did propheſie thus of Chriſt. <note n="u" place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepheard: he ſhall grather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This tender care Chriſt hath over every lamb and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſheep that belongeth to his fould. If we are then his ſheep, <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 3, 4.</note> we know his voice, we will hear it, we will follow him, and obey his voice.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith <hi>David,</hi>

                  <hi>the Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> If the Lord be our ſhepheard, then ſurely our ſhepheard is the Lord <hi>Iehovah,</hi> under whoſe ſhadow we ſhall be preſerved, and from whom we ſhall receive all ſweet conſolation and refreſhing. Thus ſaith the Lord
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118343:58"/> by his Prophet, <note n="y" place="margin">Eze. 34. 23</note> 
                  <hi>And I will ſet up one ſhepheard over them, and he ſhall feed them, even my ſervant</hi> David, which is Chriſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is reſembled <note n="z" place="margin">Rev. 2 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to the tree of life, which did bear twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every moneth, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, <note n="a" place="margin">Cant. 2. 3.</note> if we ſit down under the ſhadow of this tree, we ſhall find great pleaſure and delight, we ſhall be preſerved from the heat of Gods wrath, we ſhall be refreſhed thereby in the ſcorching heat of afflictions and fiery tryals, and under this ſhadow the burning heat of our ſinful luſts will be cooled and aſſwaged. If we feed upon the fruit of this tree by faith, which is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt crucified upon the Croſs, and his blood powred out, it will be ſweet and pleaſant to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual taſt: <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 6. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and his blood will be a fountain of living water, which will ſpring up in us unto euerlaſting life.</hi> The leaves of this tree are his gracious promiſes, which will heal and cure all the ſpiritual diſeaſes and wounds that our ſins have made in our ſouls, if we do apply them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular wound by faith.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is reſembled to a bridegroom, and then the whole Church of God, and every true believer is his ſpouſe, and his bride. That is that which <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt ſaid, <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 3. 29</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom,</hi> which he then ſpake of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, there is a wonderful joy and rejoicing between the bridegroom and the bride, and the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth Gods rejoicing over his people by this mutual joy that is between them. <note n="e" place="margin">Iſa. 62. 5</note> 
                  <hi>As the bridegroom rejoiceth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoice over thee.</hi> Who can deſcribe the perfect love of Jeſus Chriſt to his ſpouſe? who can declare the loving affections of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom towards his bride? what excellent benefits doth he beſtow upon her of his own bounty and grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118343:59"/> any of her deſervings? though ſhe hath many ſpots &amp; blemiſhes; yet he will not forſake her, but will ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her, and make her holy, chaſt, and pure, fit to be his ſpouſe, being adorned with his own ornaments of grace. This doth evidently appear in that excellent ſong of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where the admirable love of Chriſt to his ſpouſe is expreſſed, and alſo the intire affection of the Church unto him. This is Chriſt our gracious Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and theſe are ſome of the heavenly comforts that we ſhall enjoy by him, if we can imbrace him by faith, as our bleſſed Saviour, and bridegroom of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>We may now draw much comfortable matter from theſe ſeveral reſemblances of Chriſt, for the ſtrengthning of our weak faith, and for the ſupporting of our droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſpirits; alſo they will afford us excellent matter for our inſtruction, to teach us how to demean our ſelves towards him; and where to find true comfort in time of need. If we are branches of this vine, we ſhall draw grace and vertue from him to make us fruitful in all good works, to walk uprightly before God, and to live comfortable in what eſtate, or condition ſoever we be. If Chriſt be our head, we will be directed by him in all our wayes, we will ſeek unto him for protection againſt all our enemies, for preſervation from all caſualties, and dangers, and for deliverance out of all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: alſo, that we may receive from him ſome influence of ſpiritual grace, without which we cannot move one ſtep toward heaven.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt be our ſhepheard, then we muſt be harmleſs and meek, as his lambs, our ear muſt be open to his voice, we muſt follow him and none but him: <note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 2. 2. 3</note> for he will make us to lye down in green paſtures, he will lead us forth beſide the waters of comforts, and will bring us forth in the paths of righteouſneſs, and will alſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provide for us: though his rod of correction, or his ſtaffe be upon us; yet they ſhall be for our great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118343:59"/> and conſolation. So likewiſe, if we can ſhroud our ſelves by faith under the ſhadow of this tree of life, it will greatly refreſh our ſouls, and we may find cure for all our ſpiritual diſeaſes by applying the promiſes of the Goſpel, and the merit of Chriſts ſufferings to our ſelves by faith. But above all, if we can feed upon the bleſſed fruit of this tree by faith, in the hearing of the Word preached, in the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper, and in our devout and zealous meditations on Chriſt crucified for us, it will nouriſh us up to eternal life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if we are betrothed unto Chriſt by faith, he will then rejoyce over us to do us good, he will make us pure and holy, and will hide all our deformities of ſin under the robe of his own righteouſneſs out of Gods ſight, and will adorne us with his own ſpiritual and heavenly graces, that we may be lovely in his ſight, and fit to be wedded unto him for ever hereafter in the Kindome of heaven. We are alſo bound by vertue of this our union to love Chriſt with pure affections, to honour him above all, and to keep our ſelves from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The conſideration of theſe things is well worthy our ſerious and devout meditations; becauſe hereby we ſhall the better know Chriſt our Redeemer, and we ſhall draw neerer into communion with him, who is the fountain of all true conſolation, and the onely meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation, by that redemption which he hath wrought for us. This knowledge of Chriſt is above all humane wiſdom, and therefore <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> came not to the <hi>Corinthians with excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſedome, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto them the teſtimony of God. For he determined not to know any thing among them, ſave Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> Wherefore, if we can gain this heavenly knowledge by our ſtudies and meditations of Chriſt, we have enough to make our ſoules gracious here, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally bleſſed hereafter.</p>

               <head>Of Chriſts Prophetical Office.</head>
               <p>NOw we come to the ſeveral offices of Chriſt; from whence we may draw ſome profitable matter for our inſtruction, and for our comfort. And in the firſt place, God ordained him to be a Prophet, according as the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 18. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I will raiſe them up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that great prophet of the Lord, Chriſt Jeſus, who had not his Prophetical gift by divine revelation, as all the Prophets had; but it was inherent in him, and he had it from his own divine nature, and by his own power, and therefore he needed not that any thing ſhould be revealed unto him. Chriſt gave ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of this his office by way of propheſie: <note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 21.</note> for he foretold the deſtruction of the Temple, <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 19. 43, 44.</note> the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that ſhould ſhortly come upon Jeruſalem, <note n="d" place="margin">Lu. 21. 25</note> and alſo the ſigns which ſhall be before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, likewiſe he foretold <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 20. 18, 19.</note> what ſhould be done to himſelf in his paſſion, <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 26. 34</note> and how ſhamefully <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould deny him; and not a word that proceeded out of his mouth could fall to the ground, but muſt be fulfilled in due time, becauſe <note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 14. 5</note> he that was the Truth did ſpeak it. He <note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 2. 24, 25.</note> did know the ſecrets of every mans heart, he knew who believed in him, and who did not, and alſo what miſchief his enemies intended againſt him, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be hidden from him. Chriſt hath given ſome glimps of his Prophetical gift to his Miniſters, to foreſee the judgements of God that will fall upon a Nation, or people, if they are above meaſure ſinfull, and will not be reclaimed, nor brought to repentance;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118343:60"/> but Chriſt by his own preaching hath now put an end to the gift of Propheſie ordinarily.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, that every word which Chriſt hath ſpoken muſt be fulfilled, how ought we to fear and tremble at his threatnings? how careful ſhould we be to make our peace with him by ſound repentance and turning unto God, before he puts in execution what he hath threatned? alſo how comfortable are his promiſes, which in their time ſhall be performed, if we reſt upon them by faith? how can any affliction, or ſorrow tire if we reſt upon a promiſe of ſuccour from Chriſt? and how can we deſpair of our ſalvation, if we do believe, that Chriſt hath perfectly wrought our redemption, and hath made our peace with God his Father? Alſo, if it be ſo, that Chriſt doth ſee by his divine nature into the ſecrets of all hearts, we ought to be vigilant and careful to keep our hearts cleanſed, and purified from the guilt of ſinne into the blood of Chriſt, by the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewing of our faith and true repentance, that no dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin may be cheriſhed there: for he can ſee it and find it out.</p>
               <p>But this was not the chief end that Chriſt did intend in this his office: for he was anointed by the holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſm to preach the Goſpel of peace, according to this propheſie of him, <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 61. Luc. 4. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt did execute the part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical office in the whole courſe of his Miniſtry, and <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 7. 28, 29.</note>

Chriſts doctrine tended wholly to the perfect ſervice of God, to draw our minds from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this world, and to ſet our affections upon the Kingdom of heaven. Alſo, it tended to the depreſſion of our ſpiritual pride, to the mortification of our ſinful appetites, and to the ſtiring up of our heavenly cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to peace of conſcience, tranquillity of mind, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of body, and the comfort of our ſoule: in brief, his doctrine did contain whatſoever is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for he did reveal the whole counſel of God.</p>
               <p>As the doctrine of Chriſt was divine and heavenly; ſo his whole life and converſation was exactly ſutable thereunto; for it was moſt upright and holy, and a lively table, wherein was expreſſed the perfection of his doctrine. This may teach all the Miniſters of his word, to frame their lives according to the purity of their doctrine, that their good example may confirm their doctrine, and be a pattern for others to follow. Chriſt doth ſtill execute this part of his Prophetical office in his Miniſters, by the preaching of his Word, and the vertue and power of his Spirit doth alſo joyn with their continual preaching, to make it powerful for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118343:61"/> edification and inſtruction, and effectual to ſalvation. Wherefore our hearts and affections muſt be ſanctified and ſeaſoned with grace, and our eares muſt be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bored, when we come to hear the Word of God preached, and we muſt faithfully pray, that his Spirit would accompany the outward miniſtration of it, to make it profitable and comfortable to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Examine now thy ſelf, what impreſſion the doctrine of Chriſt hath made in thy heart, which thou haſt often heard ſincerely preached, and how thou haſt been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it, what knowledge thou haſt gained in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, how thou art confirmed in the truth of Gods Word, how thy faith in Chriſt is eſtabliſhed, what hope thou haſt of eternal ſalvation, and how firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy faith is grounded upon the promiſes of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, how thou art humbled for thy ſins, and what refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life it hath wrought in thee, what patience and meekneſs of Spirit thou haſt in thy ſufferings, what zeal for the glory of God, what conſtancy in thy try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and what love thou beareſt to thy neighbour: theſe and the like benefits thou maiſt have by the Word of God, if thou art a profitable hearer of it. If upon due examination of thy ſelf, thou doeſt find any of theſe operations of the Spirit of God in thee, it is a ſure evidence, that he hath made thee a profitable hearer of his Word.</p>
               <p>Many did hear Chriſts doctrine from his own mouth, and yet they received no good by it; ſo thou maiſt hear his holy Word, and be no whit the better for it, if it be not preached as wel to thy heart by the Holy Ghoſt, as it is to thine ear by his Miniſters. Oh, conſider how many worthy ſermons thou haſt heard without profit, what thou haſt been taught, and yet not edified, nor reformed; becauſe thou didſt hear them with uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ears, and with a poluted and unbelieving heart: for thy heart is naturally unfit to receive the heavenly doctrine of Chriſt, until rhe holy Ghoſt doth prepare it,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118343:62"/> and ſeaſon it with grace, that it may bring forth fruit unto newneſs of life. <note n="o" place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 12</note> There is ſo much fallow ground in us, which is barren and unfruitful, that the good ſeed of the Word of God cannot be ſown to us in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to reap the fruits of it in mercy, unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherefore imbrace the holy doctrine of Chriſt with pure affections, lay it up in a clean heart, and ruminate upon it in thy ſerious meditations, that it may abide with thee, to make thee grow dayly in grace, vertue and godlineſs, until thou comeſt to a full ſtature in Chriſt. Conſider therefore, and obſerve, how thou art inwardly affected when thou heareſt it, what delight thou haſt in it, and what impreſſion of grace it makes in thy heart: for if thou delighteſt in the Lords Sabbath, and rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt when his Word ſoundeth in thine ears, <note n="q" place="margin">Luc. 5. 41</note> 
                  <hi>as the babe did leap for joy in</hi> Elizabeths <hi>wombe, when ſhe heard the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>becauſe Christ was then in the Virgins wombe; thou art then in a bleſſed and comfortable condition,</hi>

               <p>Chriſt doth alſo teach us what we ought to do, by his works that we dayly ſee, both of juſtice and of mercy, which are his ſilent Preachers, and therefore they ought to be carefully regarded: for there is no act of his but is intended for our inſtruction. <hi>Noah</hi> was many years in building the Ark, which was a long ſermon to teach the world of the ungodly what God intended to do. God <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20</note> waited then for their repentance and converſion an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                  <hi>Noah</hi> alſo was a Preacher of righteouſneſs to them all that time, and did warn them of the wrath of God, which did hang over their heads for their ſins. Thus doth God alſo deal with us: for he doth viſit us with ſickneſs, he doth teach us thereby to prepare our ſelves for the hour of diſſolution, and to perfect our account which we muſt make to the great Judge of heaven and earth at the laſt day. that ſo we may willingly reſign up our ſelves unto God, when death ſhall part them from our bodies When God ſuffereth us to fall into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then he calls us to pray for his aſſiſting grace, for ſtrength of faith, and for conſtancy to ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the devil to the end, that he may give us the crown of victory. If he doth viſit us with loſſes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or afflictions, it is to teach us patience and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to humble our ſelves under the hand of God, until he doth deliver us. If he doth chaſtiſe us for our ſins, it is to bring us to repentance. When God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his bleſſing upon us, or removeth the croſs from us, <note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 50. 15</note> then he calls for a thankful remembrance of his mercy and goodneſs to us: howſoever God dealeth with us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in judgement, or in mercy, it ſhould teach us to glorifie him, as well in our ſufferings as for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
               <p>Thus God doth teach and inſtruct us what we ſhould do, and how to obey his will, both by his Word, and by his Works; and as our ear muſt be open to his Word, that it may be conveyed to our hearts by the holy Ghoſt; ſo we ſhould dayly obſerve the Works of God, and how he dealeth with us, that our hearts may receive inſtruction, and our tongues may bleſſe his great and glorious name. Wherefore we ought to liſten to Gods voice in them, that our hearts may return an anſwer of obedience agreeable to his will.</p>

Though our prayers and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be imperfect, and come farre ſhort of that which they ought to be; yet if they proceed from a ſincere heart, and are offered up by Ieſus Chriſt our High-Prieſt, then he will perfect them with his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and preſent them to God his Father for us, and we may reſt aſſured, that God will be pleaſed to accept them graciouſly.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing Chriſt hath made us Prieſts unto God, becauſe we belong unto him, we muſt offer up our prayers and oblations to God, and not to Saints, or Angels: for he is the author and the giver of every bleſſing and mercy that we receive, he provideth for us food and raiment, and whatſoever is needful both for this preſent life, and for that which is to come; he doth protect us from dangers, he doth ſupport us in our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and delivereth us out of our diſtreſſes, when we cry unto him with a faithful heart. We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great cauſe to aſcribe all honour and glory unto him, and thankfully to acknowledge, that God is the ſole author of all our good, to whom we muſt return all praiſe and thanks for it. Alſo, if our prayers and oblations have no relation unto Chriſt by faith, they cannot be accepted, neither can we confidently hope to receive a gracious return of them with a bleſſing, except we believe that Chriſt our Advocate will preſent them to God his Father.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118343:64"/>
               <p>If we did duly conſider, how much we ſtand in need of Gods helping hand, and of his aſſiſting grace, to carry us on through all the troubles and dangers, that we ſhall meet with in this life; alſo, how God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually follow us with his tender mercies and loving kindneſs, we would not be ſo ſlack in our prayers, and praiſes unto him; and if we did conſider that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt mount up even to the throne of Gods Majeſty, they would not be ſo cold, ſo dull, and ſo much clog'd with worldly cares and ſinful thoughts as commonly they are, which doth hinder their ſwift aſcent up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but we would labour to be more heavenly minded, and to put more holy zeal and fervency into them, and to ſend our faith along with them, which will ſoon bring them unto Chriſt, and then he will preſent them unto God for us. So likewiſe, if we conſider how careleſs we are in the worſhip and ſervice of God, how ready we are to fall from him, how imperfectly our beſt duties are performed, what ſins we dayly commit, and what wrath and fury we do juſtly deſerve for them; we ſhould then be more humble, more affected with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, and more carefull to renew our repentance every day; our ſighs and groans for our ſinnes would proceed from our hearty contrition, and from true compunction of ſpirit, and then our faith in Chriſt will give us a firm aſſurance of the pardon, and forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them all: for thus ſaith the Lord, <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 66. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore now, if we think to have our wants and neceſſities ſupplied by our induſtry in our callings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer; if we think to be ſupported in our troubles, or to be delivered out of our miſeries with prayer; to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118343:64"/> be nouriſhed at our tables, or refreſhed in our beds without prayer; and to be eaſed of our paines, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of our diſeaſes without prayer, we ſhall either miſs our deſires, or elſe we ſhall have them without a bleſſing. We cannot conceive how prevailing faithful prayer is with God, if it be preſented to him by Chriſt. Thus ſaith <hi>James,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Jam. 5. 15 16, 17, 18</note>

The effectual ſervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. <hi>Elias</hi> prayed earneſtly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years, and ſix moneths; and he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 20. 17</note> At the prayer of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God healed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,</hi> and his wife, and his maid ſervants; and they bare children <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.</note> By prayer <hi>Hannah</hi> obtained a ſonne. <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 32. 11.</note>

By prayer we may obtain any bleſſings from God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape any judgement that he hath threatned, Likewiſe our intereſt that we have in Chriſt by faith will make our praiſes and thankſgivings to God for bleſſings received to be accepted; and will alſo make them not to return empty again into our boſomes. If our repentance for our ſinnes be without faith in Chriſt, it will give us no good aſſurance of pardon, though we do expreſs all the outward ſignes of true humiliation; and though we break our hearts with grief, yet we can conceive no hope of forgivneſs without Chriſt: for Chriſt onely muſt procure our pardon, and bring us again into the love and favour of God.</p>

               <p>VVHen Chriſt had finiſhed his Prophetical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in his Miniſtry, and had wrought ſo many miracles as ſeemed good to his divine wiſdome, the time was then come, that he muſt offer up a ſacrifice to God for our redemption, which was his whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, ſoul and body for our ſins: then <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>God delivered him up to the power of the devil, and into the hands of his enemies for our offences; becauſe the guilt of all our ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes was charged upon him.</hi> For before this very time, neither the devil, nor his deadly enemies had any power againſt him: this was the time which God had decreed in his ſecret counſel, that Chriſt ſhould ſubmit himſelf to their malice and power, that the work, which God had ſent him to do might be finiſhed: and when that work was perfectly wrought, then God delivered him out of their power by his reſurrection and aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore we ought to prepare our hearts for holy and devout meditations upon the Paſſion of Chriſt, which was moſt bitter to his humane nature; becauſe the wrath of God was poured out upon him for our ſins, and the powers of darkneſs were let looſe againſt him, like ſo many wolves to worry this immaculate Lamb of God, or like ſo many fierce maſtifes againſt the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda;</hi> but the innocency of Chriſt did carry him through his whole Paſſion, and by his own power he overcame the ſury of all his enemies; though they were permitted to torment and torture him at their pleaſure, even to the death. Chriſt ſuffered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for himſelf, but it was for all thoſe that were of the election of grace, the guilt of whoſe ſins he did
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118343:68"/> take upon himſelf, and to pay their debt, to ſatisfie the penalty of the Law for them by his death; and the juſtice of God by the merit of his blood: alſo, it was to cloth them with his own righteouſneſs, that they might be juſtified in the ſight of God. Therefore, let no circumſtance of his Paſſion paſs without due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, <note n="b" place="margin">Lam. 1. 12</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto his ſorrow, which was done unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith the Lord hath afflicted him in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> How was the perfection of beauty ſtained? How was the Sun of righteouſneſſe clouded? How was the bright morning ſtarre darkned? How was the Lord of glory contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, blaſphemed, ſcorned, and ſpightfully uſed? How was perfect holineſs and innocency accuſed, rejected, condemned, cruelly tormented, and moſt ſhamefully killed? And how was Truth it ſelf deſpiſed and troden under foot? Can we think upon his Paſſion without tears, and mourning, if we belong unto him? Can we ruminate upon it, and not accuſe and condemn our ſelves, who were the cauſe, why he ſuffered theſe things, and much more? For the guilt of our ſinnes brought all this evil upon him; our ſins brought the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God from his glorious palace in heaven, to be of the loweſt degree and condition among men here upon earth, and to be expoſed to all the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, reproach and cruelty, that the devil, and wicked men could put upon him; otherwiſe we had been ſtill aliens and ſtrangers unto God; we had been ſtill under the curſe of the Law, and under the dominion and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſinne and Satan.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we have great cauſe to admire the riches of his mercy, of his goodneſs and love to us; nothing could move him to do this for us, but his tender mercy, and his free grace: for he ſaw nothing in us to move him to pitty, but our miſery and wretched condition; this was the time of his love, then did he caſt his skirt over us to hide our ſhame, and then did he undertake this great work of our r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>demption. Now let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118343:68"/> of what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, and of the great benefits which we received thereby, bind us in a firm bond of love and thankfulneſs to him, and how to expreſs it by our due reſpect to all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The incarnation of Chriſt without his Paſſion could profit us nothing; the purity of his doctrine could not edifie our hearts, if he had not ſhed his blood to clenſe us from our ſins; his prayers to God could not avail us, nor procure mercy for us, if he had not offered a ſacrifice, and ſhed his blood to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for all our tranſgreſſions; alſo, the perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of his holy life could not bring us to the integrity of converſation, if he had not died, that ſinne might be mortified, and killed in us, and if he had not alſo roſe again, to quicken us up to newneſs of life. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſion of Chriſt that reconcileth us to God, that takes away the guilt of our ſinnes, that gives us power to mortifie and ſubdue them, that pulleth out the ſting of death, that bringeth heavenly joy and comfort to our dejected ſpirits, and at length will bring ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>But an unregenerate man is not ſenſible of the bitter paſſion of Chriſt; he can feel no ſweetneſs in it, becauſe he hath no ſpiritual taſt; he knows not the power of it, and he can have no benefit by it, ſo long as he is in that condition; becauſe he hath no ſpiritual relation to Chriſt. He lives in health, wealth, and pleaſure, he feels no miſery, he is not afflicted with croſſes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſorrowes, like other men; his mind is not troubled, and his thoughts are not diſquieted for his ſinnes, they come not neer his heart; and therefore he regardeth not the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> he looks not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Paſſion of Chriſt, nor after the ſalvation of his own ſoul thereby; but he bleſſeth himſelf in this his condition, though there be no true comfort in it. Thus the devil deludes him, and leads him on in blindneſs of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118343:69"/> underſtanding, in hardneſs of heart, and in groſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to the great danger and hazzard of his ſoul; unleſs God in much mercy doth annoint his eies with his ſpiritual eye ſalve, to let him ſee his own ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to bring him unto Chriſt by faith. Let no man therefore meaſure his ſpiritual condition by thoſe outward bleſſings that he enjoyeth: for a poor man may be rich in grace and godlineſs, and a rich man may be empty and void of all piety and goodneſs. God doth commonly give more wealth to the wicked, than he doth to his own ſervants, <note n="c" place="margin">Eccl. 5 3</note> and their large portion of earthly bleſſings may be for their hurt.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, O vain man, who bleſſeth thy ſelf in thy plenty, that thy miſery is ſo much the greater, by how much thou art leſs ſenſible of thy ſinne, and the cloſer thou art joined to the world, the farther thou art from Chriſt, and the more thou delighteſt in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, the leſs comfort canſt thou have in the paſſion of Chriſt. Though thy riches and honours do dayly increaſe; yet thy ſinnes will make them bitter to thee: for the leaſt of all thy ſinnes, though conceived but in thought onely, and never acted, will bring thee under the curſe of the Law, and will make thee lyable to the eternal wrath of God, and it will ſo pollute and defile thy ſoul, and ſo poiſon the whole man, that God will abhorre thee for thy filthineſs, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver floweth from that corrupted fountain is unclean. Thy riches and pleaſures will keep thee from mount Calvary; where Chriſt was crucified, ſo long as thou delighteſt in them more than in the meditation on the Paſſion of Chriſt. The bleſſings, which thou injoyeſt, are curſes unto thee, ſo long as thou art without Chriſt, and him crucified, and continueſt in thy ſinnes without repentance. There is a ſting in every thing that thou poſſeſſeſt, which ſting is the evil of ſinne, and it will wound thy ſoul to the death, if it be not cured by the blood of Chriſt, which he ſhed in his paſſion, and it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118343:69"/> muſt be truly applied to thy heart by faith. Do not think that the mercy of God will ſave thee: for if thou haſt no intereſt in Chriſt crucified, and neglecteſt the means of grace when it is offered, the guilt of thy ſinnes cleaveth ſtill to thy ſoul, and thou canſt lay no claim to the mercies of God, but art under the ſeverity of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>Where is now the civil honeſt mans comfort, that thinks to gain heaven by his outward form of godlineſs, without the blood of Chriſt? What is the condition of the great men, and mighty hunters of this world, who think they are highly in the favour of God, becauſe they abound in all earthly pomp and pleaſure, if they have no intereſt in the paſſion of Chriſt? Surely, their condition is no better than that of the <hi>Lacdiccans,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 3. 27.</note> who thought themſelves rich and increaſed with goods, and had need of nothing, and knew not that they were ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked. If any cloud of afflictions and croſſes doth but ſhadow their earthly felicity, it takes away all their joy, and it is ready to break their hearts: for they think that to be their greateſt miſery; becauſe they do not ſee how poor, and naked they are of grace, nor the evil of their ſins, how they are holden in ſubjection to every carnal and baſe luſt, and to every evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, which will bring all miſery whatſoever upon their ſouls.</p>
               <p>But let my heart ſtill ruminate and meditate upon the Paſſion of my dear Saviour, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2</note> 
                  <hi>and let it be the deſire of my ſoul to know Ieſus Christ, and him crucified, who is my wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption.</hi> For <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>it is onely the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, that doth purge our conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 1. 7:</note> 
                  <hi>that the blood of Chriſt the Son of God, clenſeth us from all ſinne;</hi> ſo that no ſpots, no ſtaines, no guilt of ſinne ſhall cleave to our ſouls to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118343:70"/> and as he in himſelf according to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature was infinite, ſo the price, which he paid at his Paſſion for our redemption, was of infinite worth, and the benefits that we receive by him are likewiſe infinite.</p>
               <p>If we are clenſed from the guilt of all our ſins by the blood of Chriſt, then the ſting, which ſin hath put into all things that we poſſeſſe, is taken away, and we may comfortably uſe them to the glory of God; and Chriſt by his reſurrection and aſcenſion hath ſanctified them to us for our good: riches ſhall not make us proud, or ambitious, nor ſteal away our hearts from God; want and penury ſhall not make us repine, or murmur againſt the providence of God, to make us forſake him; <hi>but all things ſhall work together for our good:</hi> death ſhall not be terrible, but advantage to us, and we ſhall ſleep qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in our graves, until the general reſurrection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no guilt of ſinne will lie down with us in the duſt to follow us unto Judgement.

                  <hi>Chriſt like the good Samaritan, will pour in wine and oyl to clenſe and heal it.</hi> Though ſinne doth ſometimes over-power us; yet Chriſt by vertue of his death will ſubdue and kill it in us, and by the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he will quicken us up to newneſs of life; and he will make our unruly paſſions and ſinful deſires to be tributary and ſervants to us, by the power of his Spirit, and of his ſanctifying grace, <note n="l" place="margin">Ioſh. 9. 23.</note> as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> made the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the houſe of God</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 10.</note> Chriſt hath delivered us by his Paſſion from the wrath to come, and from all the puniſhments that are due to us for our ſins.</p>
               <p>Chriſt did not begin his Paſſion, until he had fulfilled all righteouſneſs in his life and doctrine, that the Law required; though his whole life was a life of ſuffering and of ſorrow. But when he knew that the time was at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118343:70"/> hand, when he muſt offer up his body a ſacrifice to God for the ſinnes of the world, <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 26. 21</note> he told his diſciples, that one of them ſhould betray him into the hands of his enemies, <note n="o" place="margin">Joh. 16. 32</note> &amp; that they all ſhould be ſcattered from him, and alſo what he ſhould ſuffer in his Paſſion: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he did not ſhrink from it, but did willingly undertake it; becauſe it was his Fathers will to have it ſo. Wherefore, he did arm himſelf with divine pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and meekneſs to ſuffer whatſoever was appointed in Gods decree ſhould be put upon him, and he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf by prayer for that great work. This is to teach us to ſubmit with all meekneſs of ſpirit to the will of God in all our ſufferings, how to prepare our ſelves for them, and how to demean our ſelves in them.</p>
               <p>God hath appointed every man ſome work to do, and when one work is finiſhed, he hath another ready for him: for God requires that we ſhould be diligent, and painful in our callings, frequent in holy duties, and induſtrious in his vineyard. <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 20. 6</note> The good Houſholder in the Goſpel rebuked thoſe that did ſtand all the day idle. <note n="q" place="margin">Eze. 16. 49</note> Idleneſſe was one of the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which brought down fire and brimſtone from heaven upon it.

                  <hi>that ſhe looketh well to the wayes of her houſhold, and eateth not the bread of idleneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God doth not appoint to every one their work alike: for <hi>Paul</hi> had more work appointed him, than any of the Apoſtles: <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 28.</note> for the care of all the Churches came dayly upon him. <hi>Abraham</hi> had harder work to do, when he was to offer up his onely Son to God, than any of the Patriarchs. If God appointeth much work, he will give time to doe it; if his work be hard, ſtrength, and ability to go thorough with it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if God ſhall call us to any hard ſervice, which is not pleaſing to our nature, or may ſeem impoſſible to humane ſtrength, we ought not to conſult with fleſh and blood what to do, but to be obedient to the will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118343:71"/> and pleaſure of God, though we can expect no outward help, nor ſupport in it: for if we reſt upon God, he knoweth how &amp; when to make us able to perform what he commandeth, and to bear what he layeth upon us. If we believe that God will aſſiſt us in his own work, we ſhall ſet upon it with good courage and Chriſtian fortitude. That we may the better do any work that God commandeth, we muſt prepare our ſelves for it by faithful prayer, and then reſt upon the aſſiſting grace of God with ſtedfaſt hope, that he will both help us in it, and will bleſs and proſper our indeavours to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and to our comfort. Thus we ſhould do every day in the works of our calling; but chiefly on the Lords day, when we ſhould ſpend our whole time in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now let our hearts faithfully meditate upon the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, and upon every particular that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our ſakes, and then we ſhall find the bitterneſs of it: for the wrath of God was in every part of his ſufferings, and followed him from place to place, even to mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> until divine juſtice was fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all our ſins: then we ſhall imbrace him with hearty affections, and our ſouls will reſt comforted in the aſſurance of our redemption thereby.</p>

               <p>THe hour is now come, when Chriſt muſt pay the whole debt to God his Father, which he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for us; now is the time, when the juſtice of God muſt be ſatisfied for our ſinnes, now doth God deliver up his dear Son to the powers of darkneſs, now doth he cloud the bright beams of his glorious countenance from him, and leaves him to himſelf to encounter with the devil; becauſe be ſaw the guilt of all our ſins upon him, and now doth the devil take a double advantage againſt our dear Saviour, and with all his power and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118343:71"/> malice he doth fiercely ſet upon him in a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, thinking now to prevail, becauſe God did ſeem to diſcountenance him, and alſo becauſe there was ſin, and that very great, which was laid to his charge: for the guilt of all the deteſtable and abominable ſinnes of all the elect of God was imputed to him, and the devil knew how odious and hateful ſin was in the ſight of God; alſo, the devil knew that ſuch was the rigour, and ſtrictneſſe of the juſtice of God, that he would not ſpare his own natural Son, if he found him clothed with ſinful and polluted garments. But the devil was much deceived in Chriſt: for though he had ſinne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him; yet he had no ſinne in him, he had no ſin of his own, but our iniquities were laid upon him; becauſe he did ſtand between the juſtice of God and us, to ſhelter us from the anger, and wrath of God, which was our due for all our tranſgreſſions, and alſo to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer whatſoever was due to us by the Law, to free us from the curſe of the Law: but Chriſt was no longer under the ſeverity of Gods diſpleaſure, than until his juſtice was ſatisfied, our redemption perfectly finiſhed, and our atonement made with God. Notwithſtanding the devil out of meer malice to mankind, doth labour to the uttermoſt of his power, to hinder this great work of our ſalvation, which Chriſt was now about to effect, by ſeeking to deſtroy our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>From hence we may learn to be afraid of ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the juſtice of God will ſpare none, if the guilt of ſinne be upon them, and if they are not waſhed and made clean with the blood of Chriſt by faith, but do ſleep in their ſinne without repentance. Alſo, we may obſerve the cunning and the malice of the devil againſt the children of God: for he will then ſooneſt aſſault them with his temptations, when they are under Gods viſitation, or when he doth hide the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them; becauſe he thinks then to prevail, and that they are then leaſt able to reſiſt him; whereas
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118343:72"/> God doth uſually give his ſervants moſt grace, when croſſes or afflictins are upon them. But this is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the devil can prevail no more againſt us, than he did againſt our gracious Saviour: for Chriſt will reſtrain his power in regard of our weakneſs, and he will hide himſelf no longer from us, than until we are truly humbled for our ſinnes, and that our hearts are clenſed by faith and ſound repentance. Laſtly, though the devil did what he could againſt Chriſt to hinder us of our ſalvation; yet he was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his wicked deſign: for Chriſt did confound him, and did fully finiſh his great work, which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; although it were exceeding bitter to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: thus will Chriſt confound all the enemies that ſeek the ruin of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now did Chriſt feel the burden of our ſins preſſe ſo hard upon him, that his very ſoul was heavy even to the death; now did God begin to pour out his wrath upon him, and to let looſe the principalities and powers of darkneſs to torment his innocent ſoul; and now did God offer his beloved Son a cup of trembling, and wrung out the very dregs, which he did willingly drink, becauſe his Father gave it him: for thus he ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 81. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> His Agony in the garden was but a taſt of this cup, and yet it was ſo ſtrong and ſo bitter to him, that his ſweat was like great drops of bloud trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground: ſo that an Angel was ſent from heaven to ſtrengthen him, and to comfort him in the aſſurance of his Fathers love. For the ſorrow of his heart, and the anguiſh of his ſoul, was ſo great, <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>that he prayed three ſeveral times to his heavenly Father, if it were poſſible, to let that cup paſſe from him;</hi> which was, that he might in himſelf expreſſe unto us a true Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane weakneſs for our comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when our weak fleſh fainteth under the preſſure of grief, or calamity: <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26. 41</note> for the ſpirit may be willing and

               <p>There were many bitter ingredients in this cup of our Saviours paſſion, which he was to drink for our ſakes: for every ſcorn and contumely that was put upon him, every blaſphemous word that was ſpoken againſt him, every ſtripe of the whip, every thorne that pierced his tender temples, and every nail that faſtned him to his Croſſs, were exceeding ſharp and bitter to him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was for ſinne, and they were all venomed with the malice of the devil, and the wrath of God went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him in all his Paſſion, until he had ſuffered ſo much as the juſtice of God required: but chiefly the fear of death did moſt perplex his humane nature, by reaſon of the ſting that was now in it: wherby he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth of his humanity, which was not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from humane paſſions, though it was alwayes free from the infection of ſinne. If Chriſt had not dyed for us, we had reaped no benefit by his life for; our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the lothſome diſeaſes of our ſouls had not been cured, but <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> we had ſtill remained dead in our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſinnes: for nothing could kill the power of ſinne in us, but the death of the eternal Son of God, and nothing could quicken us up in a ſpiritual life, but his reſurrection from the dead, and nothing moved him to dye for us, but his tender love and compaſſion to us. When Chriſt was in the fleſh, he had a ſhare in all our miſeries, even from his infancy, and when he was to dye, he ſuffered more than any heart is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; whereby he hath ſweetned the bitterneſs of our miſeries, and hath opened a ready way for us to find comfort in our ſufferings, if we can make our title good in him by a true faith.</p>

Chriſt our bleſſed Redeemer hath drunk the dregs of this cup for us, and hath made it a cup of ſalvation, and a cup of conſolation, healthful and profitable for us in the end, though it be bitter and uncomfortable in the taſt.

               <p>If we conceive through humane frailty, or through the weakneſſe of our faith, that this cup is to ſtrong for us, and that we are not able to bear it, we may pray, and that earneſtly and often, to have it removed, and to paſſe from us, if it may ſtand with Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to whoſe holy will we muſt alwaies ſubmit our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: for if it be not his will to deliver us, it will be his will to comfort us, if we do patiently attend his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time.</p>

               <p>Though it was the will of God that Chriſt in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſhould drink this cup, and the very dregs of it, which brought him ſo low in his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if God had forſaken him; yet his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did ſo uphold him, that he was able to bear it; whereby he hath made that cup milde and gentle to us: for all that belong unto him, muſt taſt of this cup in this life.

               <p>If we look upon our Saviours bloody ſweat, we ſhall ſee the anguiſh of his ſoul, and with what violence the devil did aſſault him: thus terrible was his Agony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the great Dragon, that old ſerpent the devil did ſet upon him with all his power, and caſt his venomous and poyſoned darts to wound his very ſoul, if it had been poſſible, and to ſting him unto death. Though the devil, and his wicked inſtruments were ſuffered at laſt to take away his life; yet the venome of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could not hurt him: for as he lived an innocent Lamb without any ſpot, or ſtain of ſinne; ſo he died a ſacrifice without blemiſh, holy and acceptable to God, and by his death he did vanquiſh ſinne, which was the ſting of death, and by his reſurrection he did vanquiſh the devil, who had the power of death, and alſo he ſubdued all the power of wicked men, and perfectly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the whole work of mans redemption. In this Agony Chriſt found the burden of ſinne ſo heavy upon him, and the power of the devil ſo ſtrong againſt him, that his ſoul was heavy even to the death. What could be wanting to add ſorrow to his ſoul, when the great dragon of hell was unchained and let looſe upon him? yet by the power of his Deity he overcame him, though he were forced to a bloody ſweat.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:118343:74"/>
               <p>If the beginning of our Saviours Paſſion was thus bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and painful to him, when he was in his full ſtrength of body, how terrible was it afterwards, when his body was faint and weak, and his ſpirits almoſt ſpent? If the devil by his own power did thus afflict his ſoul, how was he afflicted, when his ſoul and body were tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and tormented by the devil and his cruel inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his greateſt weakneſs? Wherefore, if he did ſweat drops of blood for our ſakes, it is a ſhame for us to take no pains in his ſervice for the advancement of his Name, and to ſuffer nothing for his glory? We can ſweat abundantly about our pleaſure, and profit, and about our affaires in this world; but we can feel no warmth of holy zeal in our affection; toward him; neither will we take any pains about the affairs of the Kingdome of heaven. We will not ſuffer our own name, or credit to be blemiſhed; but we hear the ſacred Name of our bleſſed Redeemer diſhonoured and blaſphemed, we are not moved at it, but we can ſuffer it well enough. Alſo we can profeſſe his Name when there is no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it; but if clouds, or ſtormes of affliction and perſecution do ariſe upon us for his ſake, we are ready quickly to ſhrink from it: or if his enemies ſtrike at him through our ſides, we are then much troubled, and we can bear no ſmart for him, though he did ſweat clots of blood for us. If this be our condition, if this be our love to our Redeemer, and our faithfulneſs to our Saviour, and if there be ſuch cowardiſe in us, that we cannot ſtand for him, we do then diſcover too much ingratitude, and unthankfulneſs to our moſt loving and dear Saviour, and too much forgetfulneſs of his great goodneſs to us.</p>
               <p>If we do wel conſider how bitter Chriſt's Agony was to his very ſoul, it will ſtirre us up to magnifie him for his grace and goodneſs, and to expreſs our thankfulneſs to his praiſe and glory by our piety in the duties of his worſhip and ſervice, and by our works of love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:118343:75"/> to his Saints in their neceſſities. For if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the comfortleſs, and relieve the needy according to our ability for his ſake, he will then comfort us when we are in any ſad condition: for he is the fountain of all true conſolation, and he knoweth by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how great a burden it is to have a ſorrowful ſoul, according to this of the wiſe man, <note n="r" place="margin">Prov. 18. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> But if we hope to find comfort in our griefs and ſorrows by ſecondary means without Chriſt, our hope will deceive us: and we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect comfort from Chriſt, unleſſe we are truly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the burden of our miſery, and that we have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him by faith: for nothing can comfort us without him, What true comfort can we have in our riches and honours, if we do not enjoy Chriſt with them, and if we have not made our peace with God by faith in him, and by our true repentance? What eaſe can the beſt Phyſick give us in our pains, or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if God doth not ſend the Phyſitian, and alſo bleſs the Phyſick we take? Yea, What Angel can comfort us in the anguiſh of our ſouls, if God doth not ſend him to give us ſome aſſurance of his love to us in Chriſt? Though it be the will of God, that in ſickneſs we uſe the lawfull means of our health and recovery, and in our troubles to uſe the means of our comfort and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; yet it is not his will that we ſhould reſt upon the means without him: but firſt we muſt have recourſe unto God, and with all humble reverence make known our ſtate and condition to him, and withall to crave his bleſſing upon the means we ſhall uſe according to our ſeveral neceſſities; and thus we ſhall receive from God what we deſire, or elſe what is better for us.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo we may learn by the example of our gracious Saviour, to wait upon God for comfort in our ſorrows, and to be conſtant in our prayers, untill he ſhall be pleaſed to return us a gracious anſwer: for

                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 26. 44.</note> Chriſt prayed three times in his Agony, before he had any anſwer from his heavenly Father; and as the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Agony did increaſe, ſo the fervency and zeal of his prayers was ſtronger. But ſuch is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our faith and confidence in God, that we are ready to give over waiting upon him, when we are in trouble, if he doth not ſend us help and ſuccour when we expect it: neither can we with Chriſtian conſtancy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in our prayers, if God doth not grant our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts at our own time, and according to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; except he doth aſſiſt and ſtrengthen us with his grace and holy Spirit. For it is Gods peculiar work to corroborate our minds, and to confirm our hearts with a ſettled reſolution to reſt and depend upon him in all our difficulties and dangers? otherwiſe we ſhall ſoon ſtart aſide at the fear of every temptation and trouble, Alſo, ſuch is our ſecurity and careleſsneſſe, that we regard not the ſorrows of the ſervants of God, we cannot mourn, though the Church of God be in great heavineſs through afflictions, we cannot watch, though we ſee eminent danger; our eyes are ſo dim and heavy, that we cannot ſee the judgements of God, that are upon a nation, or upon a people, <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 26. 43.</note> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were aſleep, when Chriſt was in this ſharpe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, <note n="u" place="margin">Jon. 1. 4, 5</note>

               <p>Conſider further, that as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt that happineſs, which he had in his creation, in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was a place of as much pleaſure, and delight, as the whole earth could afford; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt Jeſus our dear Saviour began his Paſſion in a garden, to repair our loſt happineſſe, whither Chriſt did often reſort to refreſh himſelf, and for his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118343:76"/> own private devotions; and yet there the devil did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our firſt parents, and here alſo he did violently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault our bleſſed Redeemer, to cauſe the one to fall and ſinne againſt God, and to hinder the other in the work of our redemption. Thus the devil layeth his traps and ſnares in our lawful pleaſures and delights, to catch us at advantage, and to make us ſinne againſt our God, and thus alſo he doth endeavour to hinder us in our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devotions, and in any ſpecial work which God hath appointed us to do. How then can we be free from his evil ſuggeſtions? and how can we be ſecure from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Though we can be no where free from his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet we ſhall be preſerved from the evil of them, if we keep cloſe unto Chriſt by a true and ſincere faith. Though the devil is moſt-maliciouſly bent to do us hurt; yet Chriſt will reſtrain his power, that he ſhall not do ſo much as his malicious will deſireth: <note n="w" place="margin">Iſa. 37. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>for he will put an hock in his noſe, and a bridle in his lips, to pull him back, that he ſhall not hurt our ſouls, though he may be permitted to afflict our bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore this is our ſingular comfort, that if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be any way too ſubtle, or too ſtrong for us, Chriſt will give us heavenly wiſdome to prevent his ſubtilty, and ſtrength of grace to overcome his power. If the devil doth ſuggeſt into us fears and doubtings of our ſalvation to afflict our minds, to diſquiet the peace of our conſciences, or to perplex our ſouls, Chriſt will ſweetly refreſh and comfort us with more aſſurance thereof by faith. Alſo, if he doth call our ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and doth lay them before us with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral aggravations, to affright and terrifie us, and to drive us into deſpair, Chriſt will ſhew us the clots of blood which he did ſweat in his Agony for our ſakes, and the wounds that were made in his body, that our ſins might be waſhed away in the blood that flowed from thence, and he will bid us put our finger by faith into the print of the nails, and thruſt our hand into his

They did alſo ſee the great miracles that Chriſt wrought; but they were not alike inſtructed by them: for <hi>Peter</hi> by the eye of his faith did thereby ſee his Deity, and did believe and confeſſe, that he was the Chriſt, the Son of the ever-living God; but <hi>Judas</hi> could ſee no more of Chriſt but his humane nature, though he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be a great Prophet.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Diſciples were like <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 25. 23, 24.</note> the twins in <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> womb: <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 9. 13.</note> for God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> but he hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> ſo Chriſt loved <hi>Peter,</hi>

Thus apt was <hi>Judas</hi> to learn any wickedneſſe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſchool; but he could learn no goodneſſe in the ſchool of Chriſt, though Chriſt himſelf was the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.

               <p>Theſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt are ſometimes given to unregenerate men, and yet they are no whit neerer to the Kingdome of Heaven.

                  <hi>he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out.</hi> Thus did God give him his juſt reward for his horrible ſin and impiety againſt Chriſt, and yet he was one of his Diſciples, and had as much means of grace as the reſt had, and alſo as many common and external gifts of the Spirit, as they had, and did ſee the great works that Chriſt had done: And thus will God ſhew his juſtice and judgements upon impenitent and notorious offenders, that are ſo hardned in their ſins, that no meanes of Grace can bring them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

If thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be like unto that of <hi>Peter,</hi> that thou canſt ſee a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power in the great works that are wrought here upon earth, and that God by his wiſdom and providence can diſpoſe of all the troubleſome chances and changes that happen here, either in Church, or State, to his own glory, to the good of his people, and to the confuſion of his and their enemies; then thou doeſt rightlie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the waies of God by a ſpiritual illumination
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118343:80"/> that is in thy heart. But if with <hi>Judas</hi> thou canſt no diſcern Gods divine power in his works on earth, to over-rule all adverſarie power, <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>though they rage in fury, and take counſel together againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed;</hi> then thine underſtanding is blinded, and thou lieſt open to all kind of dangers, and diſtractions of mind.</p>
               <p>Search again into thine own heart, thou that liveſt where the Goſpel of Chriſt is ſincerely preached, and his holie Sacraments rightlie and duly adminiſtered, and examine thy ſelf with what affections thou doeſt come to thoſe holie Ordinances of God, what grace is wrought in thee, and how thy faith is ſtrengthened by them, how much ſin is weakned, and how thy life is reformed. Alſo, examine what ſpiritual life thou haſt, what fruits it doth bring forth, what care thou haſt to nouriſh it by thy profitable hearing of the Word of God, and by thy worthy receiving of the Lords Supper: if thou canſt give a good account, that thou haſt ſpent thy time profitably, and haſt improved the means of grace to the beſt advantage; then thou art a faithful ſervant to thy Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> was. But if this heavenlie food will not pleaſe thy palate, it cannot nouriſh and comfort thy ſoul, becauſe thou haſt ſome ſecret corruptions, or ſome beloved ſin that keeps the ſweet influence of grace from thy heart, and then thou wilt reap as little benefit by the Word of God, and by his holie Ordinances, as wretched <hi>Judas</hi> did, though he heard Chriſt himſelf preach to him. Surely, God doth ſtill ſend down this heavenlie Manna (bleſſed be his holie name for it) and thou maieſt gather it for the nouriſhment and comfort of thy ſoul, if thou wilt; but if thou canſt find no ſpiritual ſweetneſs in it, thy taſte is not then ſpiritual, but it is dulled with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, or ſinful pleaſures, which muſt be purged out of thy heart by the blood of Chriſt, before thou canſt with <hi>Peter</hi> take pleaſure and delight to hear the words
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118343:81"/> of Chriſt, <note n="c" place="margin">John 6. 68</note> which are the words of eternall life, and before thou canſt make it the joy of thy heart to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the Statutes of God. How canſt thou hazard thy life for Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and for the truth of his Goſpel, if thou art not well inſtructed, and a good proficient in his School? And how canſt thou live a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life to God, if thy heart hath not ſucked vertue and power from Chriſt by faith, who is the fountain of this water of life, and of this coeleſtial food to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thee up to everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Look now a little upon <hi>Peters</hi> zeal for his Maſters ſafety, he reſiſted thoſe that came to apprehend him, <note n="d" place="margin">John 18. 10, 11.</note> and <hi>ſmote the high Prieſts ſervant;</hi> but Chriſt cured the wound, and rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> for it, becauſe his zeal was not well grounded: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did endeavour to hinder him in the work, which God had appointed him to do concerning mans redemption, and therefore Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>The cup which my father hath given me ſhall I not drink it?</hi> This may teach us, to drink willingly any cup of affliction that our heavenly Father ſhall give us: for it muſt needs be good and profitable to us, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from God, as from the hand of our Father. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that holy zeal, or fervency of ſpirit in Gods Cauſe is a duty which he requireth, and his ſervants do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it; yet it muſt be regulated according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to the glory of God: for blind zeal will lead us into many errours. <hi>Davids</hi> zeal was rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 139.</note>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118343:81"/> in due time. <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 3. 19.</note> When Chriſt had rebuked the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans</hi> for their lukewarmneſſe, he doth counſell them to be zealous and to amend: for this fire of holy zeal will take away the coldneſſe of our affections in our Prayers, Meditations, Thankſgivings, and in all other our holy duties to God.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the Jews had a zeal of God, but it was not according to knowledge: for they went about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſſe by the Law, becauſe they were ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, which was by Chriſt</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſtudy and labour for heavenly wiſedome, and ſpirituall underſtanding to carry thy zeal the right way, and to regulate it with an holy diſcretion, that it may not exceed the bounds of Chriſtian moderation; but that it may be ſteered according to the will of God and to his glory, and not according to thy paſſions, or to a wrong end. If there be an holy zeal in thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they will ſpeedily mount up to God, and be quick meſſengers to return thee a gracious anſwer from him; whereas cold and dull prayers aſcend up heavily to God and they will as ſlowly return with a bleſſing. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this holy zeal will put life into all thy devotions and duties to God, to make thee perform them with a willing minde, and a chearfull heart.</p>
               <p>Now look once more upon the treaſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſee if ever there was the like treachery plotted, or the like horrible fact committed upon earth, and all for baſe gain: it was plotted by the devill againſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſon of God, and acted by <hi>Judas,</hi> his accurſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt his moſt gracious Lord and Maſter; his heart was ſo ſet upon covetouſneſſe, that he loſt his ſoul

What gain did he make by exchanging his ſoul with the devill for money? this was his gain, the horrour of a guilty conſcience, becauſe he betrayed innocent bloud, a reprobate minde that could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the fearfull terrours of deſperation, which made him hang himſelf.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore how far earthly minded men will indanger their ſouls for the wealth of this world. It is true which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> that <hi>covetouſneſſe is the root of all evill;</hi> not in regard of the things coveted: for in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are the bleſſings of God, which he hath given us, and hath appointed them to be uſed to his glory; but in regard of the immoderate deſire of them, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes that is commonly uſed to get them, and the wrong end for which they are ſo eagerly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but chiefly becauſe they ſteal away their hearts from God: for they ſet their hearts upon them, and prize them above heavenly riches, they ſtick not to get them by oppreſſion, or fraud, and they covet them to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their own luſts, and not to honour God with them; they do not think that the guilt of their covetouſneſſe cleaveth cloſe to their ſouls, and that there is a ſting in their gettings, which will ſting their ſouls to death, as it did <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God doth allow us to get gain by honeſt meanes in our lawfull callings, that he may be honoured thereby, that we may live comfortably to do him ſervice, and maintain in the charge that God hath given us, and alſo to be able to ſuccour and relieve the poor.</p>
               <p>But if we covet riches for any end that is diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, or get them by any unlawfull meanes, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> we do then make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience; we truſt in our wealth, and not in God; and thus we do voluntarily ſuffer our covetous deſires to tyrannize over us, untill they bring us to perdition. How happy then is that heart which is not affected to it? how peaceable
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118343:82"/> is that conſcience which is not infected with it? and how comfortable will our lives be to us, if we can reſt content with that portion which God hath given us by our induſtry in our honeſt callings? we ſhall live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carking care, which otherwiſe in time will eat out our ſpirits, and conſume our bodies; we ſhall ſleep without trouble of minde, and though we poſſeſſe but little, yet we ſhall injoy the bleſſing of God with it, which will make that little far better to us, than to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe much, and not to have his bleſſing therewith. Alſo many rich men have great ſtore of wealth, and yet they injoy but litle of it, becauſe they have not an heart to uſe it: but they hide it as in a napkin, like that unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant in the Goſpel; ſo that God hath no glory, themſelves have no content, and others have no good by their great wealth.</p>
               <p>If we bring <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> face to face, the one will appear more beautifull and the other more deformed, and we ſhall the better diſcern the faithfulneſſe and piety of the one, and the infidelity and wickedneſſe of the other; the zeal of <hi>Peter</hi> to his beloved Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the damnable treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> againſt him: the one ſought to ſave his Maſters life, the other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, though both of them were brought up in the ſame ſchool. When vertue is ſet oppoſite to vice, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue will ſhine forth the more clearly, and vice will be the more ugly. <hi>Pilate</hi> gave the <hi>Jewes</hi> their choice of <hi>Jeſus</hi> or of <hi>Barrabas;</hi> but they choſe <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murtherer, and rejected JESUS, whom they could no way convince of any crime, which made their hatred and malice againſt Chriſt the more odious and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all poſterity.</p>
               <p>Look now with the eye of admiration upon thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and bleſſed Saviour, how willing he was to drink that cup of trembling, which his Father gave him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had a taſte immediatly before, which put him into ſuch an Agony, that his ſoul was heavy even to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118343:83"/> death, and his ſweat was like drops of blood; but now he muſt drink the dregs of it for us, and in our ſtead: for he knew that we were not able to bear it, Chriſt knew that <hi>Judas</hi> would ſeek him that night in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to betray him, and that he would bring a band of ſouldiers to apprehend him; and yet Chriſt would not abſent himſelf to avoid it, neither would he uſe the power of Angels for his defence, nor his own Divine Power to keep him from their fury and rage: for though by the power of his word they were ſmitten to the ground; yet he ſuffered them to riſe again, and he did voluntarily put himſelf into their hands, to lead him away whither they would.

                  <hi>What do ye mean to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Look alſo upon the admirable mildeneſſe of Chriſt, who gave theſe friendly and familiar words to that wicked traitor, when he came to betray him, <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 26 50</note> 
                  <hi>Friend, Wherefore art thou come?</hi> And again he ſaid, <note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Judas, betrayeſt thou the Son of Man with a kiſſe?</hi> Theſe milde and gracious words might have mollified his obdurate heart, and touched his conſcience with remorſe, if <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 1. 28</note> God had not given him over to a reprobate minde. This is to teach us meekneſſe of ſpirit, when our ſuppoſed friends prove treacherous, and when our kindneſſe is ſpitefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: for we are commanded by Chriſt himſelf, <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 5 48.</note> to <hi>bleſſe them that curſe us,</hi> to <hi>love our enemies,</hi> to <hi>do good to

               <p>But this Doctrine is unpleaſing to our corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we cannot hear it, unleſſe Chriſt doth endow us with his Spirit of meekneſſe.</p>
               <p>By the example of theſe two Diſciples, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the condition of our own hearts, whether there is the ſeed of grace in us to make us faithfull to our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that we can ſtick cloſe to him with <hi>Peter,</hi> whatſoever we ſhall ſuffer for his ſake; or the ſeed of hypocriſie, which reacheth onely to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Name, when there is no oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and when it may ſtand with their own profit and advantage: for troubles and perſecution will make an hypocrite forſake Chriſt, and hope of lucre will make him change his profeſſion of him, as it did <hi>Judas.</hi> We may alſo learn from hence, That to live in a religious family is not ſufficient to make a good ſervant, and to injoy the meanes of grace is not ſufficient to mak a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diſciple of Chriſt, except the holy Ghoſt doth change the heart and affections from their ſinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to an holy conformity to the will of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let this be the Meditation of our hearts, to expreſſe the truth of our graces by our faithfulneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in all our ſufferings for him: Alſo, ſo to live in a religious family, and ſo to improve the meanes of grace, that ſome gracious operations of the holy Ghoſt may be ſeen upon our hearts and affections by the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our lives and converſations.</p>

               </p>
               <p>His own Nation the <hi>Jews</hi> did offer thoſe blaſphemous indignities to him: for they were ever a rebellious and ſtiffe-necked people, <note n="c" place="margin">Ezech. 2.</note> which made the Lord ſo much, and ſo often to complain of them by his Prophets, and they were ſtill maliciouſly bent againſt them, becauſe they rebuked them of their ſins and rebellions againſt God: whereby we may ſee how neer it comes unto God himſelf, when his own People, and they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his Name, prove diſobedient and rebellious to him.</p>
               <p>But they could find no fault with Chriſt, <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 8. 46.</note> they could not convince him of any ſin, there was no guile ever found in his lips; he did miraculouſly feed the hungry, he cured the diſeaſed, he cleanſed the lepers, he caſt out the devils, he obſerved the Ceremonies of the Law, and paid his tribute unto <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and yet their rage and malice againſt him was full of cruelty, becauſe he laid open their groſſe hypocriſie, and condemned their vain traditions, and becauſe he diſcovered the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their hearts, and the evil of their wayes. Such was the wilful blindneſs of their Rabbies, that they would not know Chriſt, nor acknowledge him to be the Meſſiah that was promiſed, though his doctrine was moſt pure and powerful, and his life ſutable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, though he had wrought many great miracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and though moſt of their prophets had ſo plainly fore-told of him, which was fulfilled in their dayes; for they ſtumbled at his low condition of life, and could not ſee the excellencies and great worth that was in him.</p>

               <p>Though the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> did uſe opprobrious words, and blaſphemous ſpeeches againſt our ſweet Saviour, and though they did diſdainfully abuſe him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſought matter againſt him by falſe witneſſes, that they might accuſe him before the Romane Governour to put him to death; yet he did ſhew divine patience, and gave not the leaſt word of offence to his enemies, notwithſtanding they did thus ſtrongly provoke him to it. If we doe well conſider this, it will teach us, by the example of our gracious Saviour, how to demean our ſelves, when we are under the like ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it will keep us humble minded and lowly, not to be puffed up with ſpiritual pride, as the high Prieſt was; for then we ſhall give the devil great advantage againſt us; he will blind our underſtandings, that we cannot rightly diſcern that which is holy and juſt, and he will infect our hearts with hypocriſie, ſo that others ſhall be ſeduced, and beguiled by our outward ſhew of godlineſſe, whereas there is no ſincerity in our hearts, and at laſt our feigned holineſſe will be diſcovered, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5</note> becauſe we content our ſelves with a form of godlineſs, and regard not to have the power of it in our lives and converſations. Who were ſo proud of their outward holineſs as the Scribes and Phariſees? Who were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hypocrites, and did deceive more with their ſeeming ſanctity than they? And who were more cruelly and maliciouſly ſet againſt Chriſt, Gods Annointed, than they? Wherefore we ought to be very careful to keep down that high mindedneſs, which we are prone unto, if we are in any eminent place of authority in Church or State, or if we have any gifts or endowments of the Spirit above other men: <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> for <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble;</hi> leſt hereupon the divel draw us into his ſnares, to diſſemble with God, in the profeſſion of his Name, and alſo with men in our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with them.

Wherefor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Chriſtian fortitude, and an holy reſolution, that when troubles, ſorrowes, or calamities do come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, thy minde may not be diſmayed with fear, nor thy heart faint with grief, if thou muſt drink of theſe bitter waters of affliction for his ſake.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, <note n="k" place="margin">Mar. 14, 62.</note> that Jeſus plainly told the high prieſt, that he was the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that they ſhould ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven; whereupon the indignation of the high prieſt was ſuch, that he rent his clothhs, he accuſed him of blaſphemy, and judged him to be worthy of death. His proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit could not endure to hear ſuch great things of ſo poor and ſilly a man as he conceived Chriſt to be; but he was tranſported beyond the bounds of ſound judgement with a kinde of blinde zeal, or rather with furious hatred againſt Chriſt: for he would not believe his report; though he had declared himſelf ſo plainly to him; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this of the Prophet, <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.

                  <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed?</hi> This Propheſie of Chriſt was at this very time fulfilled, for now he was brought into ſuch troubles, and into ſuch danger of his life, that none believed what the Prophets had reported of him, or what he did ſpeak
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118343:86"/> of himſelf, his Divine Power was clouded from them, he was as a man not able to help himſelf, and his own Diſciples ſtaggered in their faith of him at this time.

               <p>Thus the ſting of that old Serpent went along with the words of a ſilly damoſel, which <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſuſpect, and they entered ſo deep into him, that they poyſoned his heart with unbelief, and made him to denie that he was a follower of Jeſus, and alſo he began to curſe and ſwear that <hi>he knew him not,</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118343:88"/> look back upon him, and touched his heart with his Spirit, <note n="c" place="margin">Mark. 14.</note> and made him remember the crowing of the Cock, which was the token of remembrance that Chriſt gave him. Then <hi>Peter</hi> knew how heinouſly he had ſinned, and then alſo he preſently went out from that wicked companie to avoid further occaſions of ſinning, <hi>and wept bitterly,</hi> which was a true Teſtimonie of the ſorrow of his heart, becauſe he had ſo groſly denied his dear Maſter.</p>
               <p>Here we may diſcover the frailty of the fleſh, though we be in the ſtate of Grace, if God doth not ſtill uphold us with the power of his Grace: For our paſſions will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us, our ſins will prevail againſt us, and every tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the Devil will make us let go the Anchor of our Hope in God, if we had not the benefit of Chriſts prayer, that our Faith fail not in theſe our ſpiritual conflicts. Here alſo we may ſee what deep impreſſion ſudden fear will ſometimes make in our hearts: for it will ſink our Spirits, and take away all humane Strength and Courage. Thus it was with <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, when they found their Mony in their Sacks mouth: <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 42. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>for their heart failed, and they were afraid.</hi>

                  <note n="e" place="margin">Denr. 11. 25.</note> becauſe <hi>the Lord did lay the fear of them, and the dread of them upon all the Land.</hi> Sudden fear will alſo ſhake the very foundation of our faith, and of all other ſpiritual Graces that are in us, as it wrought upon <hi>Peter</hi> at this time. This is an humane Paſſion that all men are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto; but a good Conſcience, and a watchful Eye are the beſt preſervatives againſt it: For as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 53. 4, 5.</note>

               <p>Here alſo we may diſcover the policy of the Devil, who putteth his Hook into ſuch plauſible and harmleſs Baits, as do give us no occaſion to ſuſpect any hurt or danger, whereby we are eaſily brought under his power, if we have not the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit to eſcape them.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118343:89"/> Wherefore, we have great cauſe to ſtand continually upon our watch, and to ſuſpect our own ſtrength, and to be careful what we ſpeak, and what we hear, what we do, and what we ſee done, what ſteps we tread, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany we come into: for there might be much danger, where we ſee no appearance of it. Let <hi>Peters</hi> example keep us from preſuming upon our own ſtrength; leſt God doth permit the Devil to winnow us as Wheat, that we may know how weak we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This fear is not ſlaviſh, but it is an holy and a true filial fear, which will keep us from all occaſions of ſin, whereby God may be diſhonoured, and it will bring us to an holy care, how to walk circumſpectly before God in all Piety and Godlineſs; it will alſo reſtrain us from all ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and put us forward to the practiſe of all holy duties.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo we may draw ſweet Conſolation to our Souls, though the meaſure of our Faith and of other Graces be but ſmal: for the Devil can do nothing without leave and permiſſion from God, who will not give him power againſt us above our ſtrength, but will reſtrain him from effecting that; which his malicious will doth intend and purpoſe for our hurt. He may be permitted to ſift us with his temptations, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> he may bring trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions upon us, as he did upon <hi>Job;</hi> but he ſhall never overthrow our Faith, nor quite bereave us of Hope: for God will ſo order and diſpoſe of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they ſhall procure our good, either to purge us from ſome corruptions that we cheriſh, or elſe to make us keep more cloſe to our God; and this is our great comfort, That Chriſt hath Prayed for us, that our Faith might hold out to the end, though the combat we fight be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous, and our ſtrength very weak.</p>
               <p>Afflictions and Croſſes will try our patience, Scorns and Reproaches will try the meekneſs of our ſpirits, Want and Penury, will try our truſt and confidence in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118343:89"/> providence of God, anguiſh of Soul for ſin will try our Faith and Hope in Chriſt, want of anſwer to our praiers will try the fervencie and faithfulneſs of them, and the fear of perſecution, or torment, will try our conſtancie and perſeverence in the truth. If we find anie Grace weak in us, Chriſt will make it ſtronger, if we ſue unto him for it by our faithful Praiers: For the Spirit of Grace reſted upon him, that Grace might plentifullie flow down to all that have intereſt in him by Faith: <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 13. 3. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>If this be our Condition, that we are daily ſubject to divers temptations, which of our ſelves we can neither prevent, nor overcome, we muſt then keep cloſe to our gracious Saviour and Redeemer, who onlie can keep us from them, or preſerve us in them, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 30. 13.</note> and <hi>he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above the ſtrength of our Faith; but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it.</hi>

                  <hi>Though we fall, we ſhall not be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt down:</hi> For our Lord Chriſt holdeth us with his hand, and he will raiſe us up again by true repentance, as he did <hi>Peter.</hi> If the floud-gates of ſorrows are ſet open upon us if the fear of troubles, or the fear of death doth ſurprize us, Chriſt will ſtop thoſe ſloud-gates, and will comfort us at the hour of death; or elſe he will give us an eye of Faith, not to look upon them with a ſad and heavie heart; but to look up above them to that coeleſtial happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he hath prepared for us, which no eye hath ſeen, no tongue can expreſs, and no heart can conceive, and to wait patientlie for it, until Chriſt our ever bleſſed Redeemer ſhall reveal it to us, which will be but in part in this life by Faith; but fullie and perfectlie in the life to come according to everie mans capacitie. Alſo, if the Devil doth aggravate our ſins, and ſers them before us in a multiplying Glaſs to the breaking of our hearts with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſorrow, and to the anguiſh of our Souls, which will make us ſhed many bitter tears for them, as <hi>Peter</hi> did,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118343:90"/> then Chriſt will look graciouſlie upon us, and will give us a double meaſure of true conſolation by the aſſurance of the pardon and forgiveneſs of them.</p>
               <p>We may further learn Inſtructions by <hi>Peters</hi> fall, that if we give way to any ſin, the Devil will eaſily draw us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to higher degrees of ſinning, as he did <hi>Peter:</hi> For at the firſt he did but ſimply deny Chriſt, then he denied him with an oath, <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 26. 74.</note> 
                  <hi>And at laſt he began to curſe and to ſwear that he knew not the man;</hi> and therefore we muſt be very careful to nip ſin in the bud, leſt it lay us open to the Devils tyranny, or ſtop the current of grace to our hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall not be able to recover our ſelves; but rather we ſhall fall away more and more from God. Sin is a ſpiritual gangrene to the ſoul, which will eate into all the faculties of it, if it be not in time cut off, and killed by faith in the death of Chriſt, and by true Repentance. There is ſo much of the unregenerate part in the beſt of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as that they ſin daily, and the Devil is ready to take advantage upon every ſin; but he cannot eaſily faſten his ſting upon their ſins; becauſe they are not glued ſo faſt to their hearts, but that they may eaſily remove them: wheras his ſting will ſoon take hold of any ſin that is rooted in us, either by cuſtome, or by delight, to wound our ſouls even to the death. If we ſleight the leaſt ſin, it will bring us on to greater, and if we be careleſs of ſmall ſins, they will bring us to a cuſtom of ſinning, which will quickly beget an habit of ſin in us, which is a fit ground for the Devil to work upon, to keep us from returning unto God, and to plunge us deep into the gulf of ſin, unleſs Chriſt in his abundant mercy doth touch our hearts with his Spirit, to let us ſee from whence we are fallen, and doth alſo give us grace to repent and return to the Lord, and then we ſhall keep a more diligent watch over our ſelves for the time to come.</p>
               <p>If we look upon our ſelves in <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhall ſee that we alſo are ſubject to the like deluſions of the Devil; we are as ready to deny Chriſt, and to fall away from God, as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118343:90"/> he was, and the fear of trouble, perſecution, or danger for Chriſt will prevail as much with us, as it did with him, to make us renounce our Profeſſion and the Truth of the Goſpel, and to bring us to the brink of perdition; but Chriſt will not ſuffer us to fall into that bottomleſs pit, but will look upon us in mercy, as he did upon <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Devil did delude <hi>Peter</hi> with vain hope, that by this means he ſhould eſcape the trouble and danger that might come upon him, if it were known that he was a Diſciple of Chriſt: for thus he brought him into the ready way to loſe the grace and favour of his Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, and into the way that leadeth to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Thus alſo doth the Devil delude us, if we truſt him: for he will promiſe all worldly wealth and earthly pleaſures, and will give to ſome a large portion of them in part of payment; but in the end he will pay them with wormwood and gall, which will be more bitter to them, than <hi>Peters</hi> tears were unto him. When we think our ſelves moſt ſtrong, then we are ſooneſt overcome; and when we preſume moſt upon our own ſtrength, then we give the Devil the greateſt advantage againſt us. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity we think our ſelves ſo ſtrong, that we cannot be ſhaken, we are then ſecure and able to ſtand unmoveable againſt any oppoſition; <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 10: 22.</note>

When Jeſus was tranſfigured upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118343:93"/> deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Almighty.</hi> Why then ſhould we miſtruſt the love and favour of God, when we are under his viſitation? Why do we not put more confidence in his power, to defend us? more truſt in his care to preſerve us? and more hope in his promiſes to ſave and deliver us from our enemies, and out of troubles and dangers? Wherefore if we do piouſly meditate upon theſe things, it will be a great ſtrengthening to our Faith, and exceeding comfortable to our ſouls in all our temptations, ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>Conſider in the next place, that as Chriſt appointed the crowing of the Cock to be <hi>Peters</hi> remembrancer of his ſin; ſo likewiſe God in much mercy hath many waies to put us alſo in minde of our ſins, and to call us to ſpeedy repentance for them, which we ought with all care and diligence to mark and obſerve. If God doth forbear and ſuffer us to go long unpuniſhed for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> his goodneſſe herein ſhould lead us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But if he doth give us any check of conſcience, or layeth any affliction upon us, they are as ſo many warnings to make us remember our ſins with grief of heart, and to bring us to repent of them, that we may eſcape the evill which otherwiſe our ſins would bring upon us. But when the holy Ghoſt doth touch our hearts, as he did <hi>Peters,</hi> he will work with unreſiſtible power to make us think upon our ſins with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, with true contrition and compunction of ſpirit, with hatred and deteſtation of them, he will make us confeſſe and acknowledge them before God, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to crave the forgiveneſſe of them by Faith in Chriſt, and to have an holy aſſurance of it by our true and ſound repentance. But if we remember our former ſins with delight and approbation, we ſin them over again, and this remembrance is ſinfull, and it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from our corrupted nature, and not from grace, which will never bring us to forſake them, or to repent
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118343:93"/> of them. When Peter came to himſelf, and remembred his unthankfulneſſe to his Lord and Maſter, and did ſee from whence he was fallen, he was wounded to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul, and preſently went out to ſeek a place where he might eaſe the grief of his heart with his bitter teares.</p>
               <p>Conſider now with all pious devotion, how dangerous it is, and what advantage we give the divell, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate any ſins, as namely ſwearing, lying, uncleanneſs, drunkenneſſe, Sabbath-breaking, or the like: for it will faſten the guilt of that ſin cloſer to our ſouls, which will not be removed without bitter teares; but will preſs us down to the pit of deſtruction. Conſider alſo, that great and crying ſins require loud cryes, deep ſighs and grones, and many teares, which we cannot pour forth, untill we do abandone all our wicked and lewd companions, and all former occaſions that did intiſe or provoke us thereunto, and untill Chriſt doth look upon us, and touch our hearts with his Spirit, to let us know that he doth take notice of them. <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 13.</note> We ſhould therefore watch and ſtand faſt in the faith, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from Chriſt; but ſupport our faith with ſtedfaſt hope and aſſurance, that he will ſtabliſh us with his free Spirit, never to fall away from him totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay as ſometimes <hi>Peter</hi> did, that though thou ſhouldſt dye with Chriſt, yet thou wilt never deny him, nor forſake him, but do not truſt too much to thine own ſtrength, though thou art in the State of grace: for if Chriſt doth not uphold thy faith, the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations will prevail againſt thee, thine own heart will deceive thee, and the devill will be too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for thee. <note n="f" place="margin">Ezech. 33. 31.</note> Thou maiſt honour Chriſt with thy, lips, and yet in heart thou maiſt deny him: for if the power of a Chriſtian life goeth not along with thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, thou doſt then diſhonour his holy Name, doſt forſake Him in thy heart. If there be ſuch
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118343:94"/> unfaithfulneſſe in thee to Chriſt thy Saviour, and if there be ſuch hypocriſie hidden under a fair profeſſion, then every rumour of trouble, or danger for Chriſt, every alluring vanity, and every delightfull ſin will make thee turn aſide from him <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 78. 57.</note> like a <hi>deceitfull bow;</hi> becauſe thy heart is not well ſeaſoned with grace, to make thee ſtand firm and ſtedfaſt unto Chriſt, and to his truth againſt all oppoſition.</p>
               <p>If this be thy fidelity to thy Saviour, and if thou doſt repoſe ſo little confidence in him, then ſurely he will not regard thee, though thou doſt howle and call unto him day and night, when thou art in any diſtreſſe or miſery. The Lord complaineth of his own people, <note n="h" place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14</note> that they had not cryed unto him with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: for they did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let there be truth and ſincerity in thy heart, that thy heart and thy tongue may go together in thy Prayers, in thy vowes, and in all thy ſervices to God and man: let thy heart and thy hand go together in thy almes to the poor, and in all thy works of charity: for if thy heart be not faithfull to God, thy beſt ſervices and duties cannot be accepted. Alſo keep thy heart cloſely knit to Chriſt by faith, and then he will caſt an eye of mercy upon thee, as he did upon <hi>Peter,</hi> if at any time through humane weakneſſe, or upon the violence of any paſſion, or ſtrong temptation thou ſhalt fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him. Thy heart is that which Chriſt requireth: for thus he ſaith by <hi>Solomon, My ſon give me thy heart:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi rend="sup">i</hi> Prov. 23. 26.</note> give not thy heart therefore to the pleaſures and vanities of the world, nor to carnall luſts and delights; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God.</p>
               <p>Now Meditate ſeriouſly upon all the circumſtances of <hi>Peters</hi> fall, and thou wilt find thy ſelf likewiſe ſubject to the like provocations, and to the like frailties and failings; and learn inſtruction thereby, not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe dangers and temptations do every where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118343:94"/> attend thee, and not to preſume upon thine own ſtrength, for that will not preſerve thee; but labour to be well rooted in the truth, and well grounded in the faith, and love of Chriſt, and then no ſpirituall enemy ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt thee, and the cunning ſtratagems of the divell ſhall not hurt thee, no fear of perills and dangers ſhall make thy faith in Chriſt to fail, and no afflictions or troubles ſhall make thee out of hope of the love and favour of God in Chriſt, but thou wilt reſolve ſtill to be faithfull to thy Saviour, and to keep thy heart ſincere and upright towards God; and then Chriſt will reſtore thee if thou falleſt, he will heal thee by repentance, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> if thou art wounded, and whatſoever thou feareſt ſhall not diſmay thee. Chriſt will be thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all thy ſorrowes, thy hiding place in all dangers, and he will be thy defence againſt all thy ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they ſhall not overthrow the ſalvation of thy ſoul.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Chriſts ſufferings under Pilate.</head>
               <p>NOw we come to conſider what Chriſt ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pilate,</hi> and how the immaculate Lamb of God was hurried from the wolfe to the lyon, and from thence to the bear, and back again to the lyon, and ſo to the ſhambles, where he muſt be ſlain. For the more his Divine graces did ſhine forth in the purity of his life and Doctrine, the more did the divel rage, and the malice of the Jews increaſe againſt him. He is now brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Luk 23.</note> and thither did the chief Prieſts and Elders come with their falſe accuſations againſt him. They likewiſe follow him from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> before whom alſo they falſly accuſed him with much vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet they reſt not there, but they returned again to <hi>Pilate</hi> with their hearts full of envy and malice, and their mouthes full of opprobrious ſpeeches and blaſphemies
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118343:95"/> againſt the innocent Lamb of God, to put him to death. Thus they perſecuted the Lord of glory our gracious Redeemer, and yet theſe wicked diſſembling Rulers did hide and cover their groſſe hypocriſie, and their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh malice under the pretence of ſanctity and holineſſe: <note n="b" place="margin">Joh 18. 28</note> for they refuſed to go into <hi>Pilates</hi> judgement-hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled; but that they might eat the Paſſeover, for this was the preparation day. What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe can there be in a malicious heart? How can the heart be prepared to ſerve God aright, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſtained with the guilt of ſin? and how durſt they eat the Paſſover, when there was ſo much ſoure leaven of hateful malice in them? but they did ſtand more upon the outward form of godlineſſe, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with pure affections, and with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now we may eaſily ſee what Satans drift is againſt the ſervants of God: for if he did ſtirre up all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſecute Chriſt Jeſus our Head with deadly hatred, he will not ſpare us that are his members; and he will ſet upon thoſe that are moſt eminent in grace with his ſtrongeſt aſſaults. Thus he aſſaulted <hi>Job</hi> with many and great afflictions, one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to overthrow his patience. <note n="c" place="margin">1 Chro. 21. 1.</note> Thus he ſtrongly tempted <hi>David</hi> to number the people, to make him truſt in the arm of fleſh, and to weaken his confidence in God; <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> and thus he buffeted <hi>Paul</hi> with his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and many ſore afflictions. But this is our comfort, that he can do no more than God doth permit him, he cannot exerciſe his power according to his malice: for God will not ſuffer him to aſſault his weak ſervants with ſtrong temptations; and though he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit him violently to ſet upon thoſe that are rich in grace and ſtrong in faith; yet he will order and diſpoſe his attempts for their good, and not for their deſtruction, as the divell doth maliciouſly intend. God will make them ſerve for the triall and manifeſtation of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118343:95"/> their graces, for the preventing of ſpirituall pride, and for the confirmation of their faith, and affiance in God by that experience of his aſſiſtance and gracious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, which hereby they have gained.</p>
               <p>From hence we may learn how to be prepared, when we come to the Lords Table to eat of his holy Supper, how to come to the hearing of his Word, and how to addreſſe our ſelves unto Prayer, and to pious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If we come to theſe holy Ordinances with pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted hands, and with hearts defiled with the guilt of ſin, as theſe Rulers did to eat the Paſſover, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſoever we pretend, we do but diſſemble with God, we delude our own ſoules, and God will neither hear us nor accept us.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt caſt out the leaven of ſin, and purge our conſciences from dead works by faith in the bloud of Chriſt, before we come into the preſence of God, that our affections may be quickned and raiſed up to theſe heavenly and Divine Ordinances of God. But if our ſins do ſtick cloſe to our ſoules by our delight in them, they will binde us over to judgement, and to condemnation; and therefore we muſt not ſeek to hide them, or to colour them over with fair pretences, as if God could not ſee them; but we muſt confeſſe them, and lay them open before God from a truly humbled and penitent heart, that ſo we may come before him in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and in truth: for <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 44. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>God knoweth the ſecrets of our hearts.</hi> But if we will hide our ſins quite out of Gods ſight, we muſt hide them under the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: for there is no other hiding place for ſin, but under this robe.</p>
               <p>Thus the guilt of our ſins may be hidden from God, if we can apply to our ſouls Chriſt crucified, and his righteouſneſſe by faith. Alſo if we have a true aſſurance by our repentance, that our iniquities are forgiven, we may then, and not before, draw near unto God with comfort, and we may partake of his holy Ordinances
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118343:96"/> with much profit: for they are appointed for us, if we are thus prepared for them, and beſtowed onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as have intereſt in Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p>We come now to look upon the innocency of our bleſſed Redeemer, who was without ſpot or ſtain of ſin, both in the ſight of God and in the ſight of man; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not have ſaved us from our ſins. Thus ſaith God himſelf of him, <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">John 8. 46</note> 
                  <hi>Which of you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Phariſees, <hi>convinceth me of ſin? Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did ſtrictly examine him, and yet they could find no fault in him. <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 23. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf did freely confeſſe that <hi>Chriſt was blameleſſe, and therefore he ſought meanes how to releaſe him.</hi> Alſo, <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 27. 19</note> 
                  <hi>his wife ſent to him ſaying, Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man: for ſhe was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that night by ſome revelations concerning him.</hi> Though Chriſt was accuſed of many things, yet nothing could be proved againſt him: notwithſtanding Chriſt was willing in obedience to his Fathers will, to ſuffer the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that God had appointed for mans redemption: for if any part of this great Work had been left unfiniſhed, he could never have procured our atonement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore here is matter of great comfort for our hearts to meditate upon: for though the guilt of all our ſins was imputed unto Chriſt, yet he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed therewith, and though he ſuffered for ſin, yet it was not for his own, but for the ſins of all the Elect of God, which he took upon himſelf: for the perfection of his purity, and of his righteouſneſſe did ſtill remain unſpotted, and undefiled, that we might be cloathed therewith, by faith, to hide our nakedneſſe, and the ſhame of our ſins when we come into the preſence of God to perform any holy ſervice unto him; but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we ſhall appear before his dreadfull Tribunal at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo we may draw much conſolation,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118343:96"/> when we are falſely accuſed, ſpitefully uſed, or cruelly perſecuted for the Profeſſion of the truth, and for a good conſcience: for our dear Saviour hath ſuffered the like in our Nature and for our ſakes, that theſe and the like ſufferings might be ſanctified to us, and that we ſhould follow Chriſts example of patience and meekneſs when we are under them.</p>
               <p>We need not therefore be diſmaid, when we are thus unjuſtly dealt with: for Chriſt hath taken away the evill of theſe ſufferings, and hath taught us how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our ſelves under them; and if we wait patiently upon God, he will in due time make our innocency break forth like the Sun out of a cloud to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to our great comfort.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, and admire to ſee, how the malice and cruelty of the chief Prieſts and Scribes did increaſe againſt Chriſt: for when they perceived that <hi>Pilate had</hi> cleered his innocency, and was willing to releaſe him, their rage and fury was the more inflamed, <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 27. 20.</note> inſomuch as they moved the people to deſire that <hi>Barrabas</hi> might be releaſed to them who raiſed ſedition in the City, and was alſo a Murtherer, and that JESUS might be crucified, which kinde of death was moſt ignominious, moſt ſhamefull and accurſed. Though they knew by their own Law what a crying ſin in the eares of God the ſhedding of innocent blood was; yet no blood could ſatisfie them but innocent blood. <hi>Pilate</hi> offered them the blood of <hi>Barrabas;</hi> but that would not content them: for they thirſted after the pureſt blood that ever was ſpilt, even the moſt precious blood of the eternall Son of God; becauſe he laid open their corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and diſcovered their hypocriſie to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The cruell Jews did ſhed the blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were ſent to them, and now they do eagerly hunt after the blood of Chriſt, whom they could no way convince of any ſin. Thus doth their diveliſh envy and malice carry on to the higheſt degree of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118343:97"/> againſt God and againſt his Anointed.</p>
               <p>Now let us meditate with an holy zeal and pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion upon the price of our Redemption: <note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>for we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from our vain converſation; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> who was both God and Man; ſo that the Jews crucified him that was <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> and the blood which they ſpilt was the blood of that Perſon, who was God as well as Man, according to this of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 20. 28</note> 
                  <hi>That God hath purchaſed to himſelf a Church with his own blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeing we are bought with ſuch a price, we ought to glorifie God in our bodies, and in our ſpirits, which are Gods,</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 6. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and not to fall away when we have taſted of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the world to come; ſeeing thereby we crucifie to our ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame by our new committed ſins after repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, we muſt ruminate upon the tranſcendent worth of the blood of our crucified Redeemer with pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: for it was an infinite price to ſatisfie the juſtice of an infinite God. We cannot conceive, much leſſe expreſſe the incomprehenſible goodneſſe of Chriſt, who of his meer love hath given up himſelf and his whole nature, both Divine and Humane, to purchaſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption with his own blood. His Deity of it ſelf could not ſuffer either hunger or thirſt, pain or torment: for theſe and all other his ſufferings did properly belong to his humane nature; but by the perſonall union of his humanity with his Deity, the Divine nature of Chriſt did ſuffer together with his humanity by a nearer ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, than is between the members of the naturall body and the head, or between the members of the myſticall body of Chriſt, and himſelf, who is their Head: for theſe members both naturall and ſpirituall are but knit and united to the head by firm ligaments; but the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt was taken up into his Deity, and ſo
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:118343:97"/> made one Chriſt. <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted Chriſt, when he did perſecute his Church: for thus ſaith Chriſt unto him, <note n="q" place="margin">Act. 9. 4, 5</note> 
                  <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid, Who art thou Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt:</hi> for he perſecuted him in his members, he being their Head. How much more then did the Deity of Chriſt ſuffer throughout his whole paſſion by ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing with his humane nature, not onely as <note n="r" place="margin">Cor. 11. 3</note> God is the Head of Chriſt, but chiefly becauſe his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was perſonally united to his Deity, this is the cauſe why the blood of Chriſt, his ſufferings, and his death is of ſo great merit, and of ſuch an infinite price.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, that Chriſt did give himſelf in his whole nature for us, that his blood ſhould be ſpilt, his body mangled and tortured, his ſoul tormented, his Glory clouded with ignominy and ſhame, and that his Deity ſhould be blaſphemed and ſpitefully diſhonoured for our redemption, and if we were bought with ſo great a price; we have then as great cauſe as ever <hi>David</hi> had, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 103<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> to <hi>bleſſe the Lord, and to ſtirre up all that is within us to praiſe his holy Name for all the benefits of our redemption: for he forgiveth all our iniquities, he healeth all our diſeaſes, he redeemeth our lives from deſtruction, and he crowneth us with loving kindneſſe and tender mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we can apply to our ſelves by a true faith, Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified for us, <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, he will faſten the guilt of our ſins to his own croſſe, that it ſhall not cleave to our ſouls, and he will remit the puniſhment that is due to us for them; alſo, he will heal and cure all the ſpirituall diſeaſes of our ſouls by powring clean water upon us, and by ſanctifying us with his grace and holy Spirit unto newneſſe of life, which is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the pardon of our ſins, and then he will imbrace us with the armes of his love, and will crown us with everlaſting peace.</p>
               <p>Conſider yet further to what height of impiety the ſpiteful and malicious Jews are brought, <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 27, 24.</note>

               <p>Wherefore let the thoughts and the Meditations of our hearts be, how to moderate and ſuppreſſe our raſh, and raging paſſions, that they break not out to wicked wiſhes, or impious execrations to our own hurt, or to the hurt of another; but ſpecially concerning blood, leſt God that heareth in heaven ſhould ſay, Amen to it: for then the guilt of that ſin will lye heavy upon us, and the evill which we have unadviſedly wiſhed will be grievous to them; except we do ſpeedily repent, that God in mercy may forgive us. We ſhould therefore
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:118343:98"/> ſet a continuall watch before our lips, that we ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt themſelves, or to the hurt of another: for God in his juſtice may bring the ſame evil upon us, which we have wiſhed either to our ſelves or to others; but we ought to accuſtome our ſelves to bleſſing and not to curſing, to wholeſome ſpeeches that may tend to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and not to miſchievous words that tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and then God in mercy will ſay Amen to it.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve and mark what barbarous cruelly the Gentiles did uſe againſt our dear Saviour: for as ſoon as he was condemed, <note n="z" place="margin">Mar. 15. 15.</note> they ſcourged him without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſtripes; ſo that this of the Pſalmiſts was verified in Chriſt, <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 129. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows:</hi> whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> were limited by the Law of God to fourty ſtripes. When Chriſt was thus<note place="margin">b Deut. 25 3:</note> cruelly ſcourged, then <hi>Pilate</hi> delivered him to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> and then the ſavage Gentiles did mock and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride him, they did ſpit upon him, they crowned him with thornes, and ſmote him on the head with a read, and then they led him away to be crucified.</p>
               <p>This was a dolefull ſpectacle, and able to make a deep impreſſion of tender compaſſion in any Chriſtian heart, to ſee a righteous man thus miſerably tortured; but much more to ſee the onely begotten Son of God thus diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and thus ſhamefully uſed with as much diſgrace and ſhame as they could deviſe. But ſuch inhumanity did reign in their murthering mindes, and ſuch cruell deeds were acted with their bloody hands, that nothing could ſwage their malice and cruelty; and nothing could mollifie their ſtony hearts, or melt them into compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate pitty; becauſe they were given up to a reprobate minde.</p>
               <p>But let our hearts be touched with a true ſenſe of our Saviours ſufferings, and with a godly ſorrow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction for our ſins, when we ruminate and ponder in our thoughts, how unjuſtly our bleſſed Redeemer was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118343:99"/> condemned, and how cruelly he was uſed for our ſakes: for Gods controuerſie was againſt us, and not againſt his dear Son. But becauſe he of his tender love and compaſſion, ſtept in between Gods fierce wrath and us, which he knew was too heavy for us to bear, and took upon himſelf the guilt of our ſins, and becauſe the deſire of his ſoul was to reconcile us to God his Father, he was willing that ſo much of Gods ſevere wrath, as in juſtice was due to us for our tranſgreſſions, ſhould light upon himſelf, which he did meekly undergo to free us from it. If we are thus affected when we do ſeriouſly think upon the paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt, it will make us hate our ſins with a perfect hatred, it will pull down our proud and haughty ſpirits; it will make us thankfully to acknowledge our unworthineſſe of ſo great love from him, and it will bind us in a firm bond of love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: then Chriſt will commiſerate and pitty us in our ſorrowes, and will comfort us in our ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>But alas, we take no pleaſure in ſuch dolefull Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, we are not feelingly affected with our Saviours tedious and bitter paſſion, and therefore we cannot bring it home to our ſelves by faith; neither can we raiſe up the affections of our hearts hereunto, becauſe we are not perſwaded that he ſuffered more than his humane nature could have born, if it had not been ſupported by his Deity; neither do we faithfully believe, that what he ſuffered was for our redemption, as it was for all the elect of God; and therefore we can draw no ſpirituall comfort from thence to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſad contemplations are not ſweet to our taſte, they are not delightfull to our corrupted nature, nor pleaſing to our carnall deſires: for we had rather go to the houſe of feaſting, than to the houſe of mourning: our love to Chriſt is not ſo firm, and our faith in him is not ſo ſtrong as to make our mindes conſtant in theſe heavenly Meditations, which are moſt profitable for the good of our ſouls.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:118343:99"/>
               <p>If we find ſuch obduracy in our hearts, ſo little grace in our affections, and that our unregenerate part is ſo prevailing in us, that we can take no pleaſure to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the bitter paſſion of Chriſt, as if he were not to be pitied; we may juſtly condemn our ſelves of too much ingratitude for his great love to us, and we cannot then expect any compaſſion from him in our afflictions and miſeries.</p>
               <p>If we look upon a Kings onely Son, and ſee him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all kind of rebuke and ſhame by rebells and traitors, and all kinde of torturings and tormentings for no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given, ſhall we not pity his miſerable condition? And ſhall we not think upon his miſeries with ſad hearts? Then much more ſhould we be compaſſionately affected when we remember what great things Chriſt hath ſuffered for us; and yet the remembrance of them ſhould be delightfull to us, becauſe it was the Work of our redemption, and the price which he paid for our ranſome out of that ſpirituall bondage wherein we were holden by ſin and Satan.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thy Saviours ſufferings have made any impreſſion in thy heart, ſhew ſome fruits of thy thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to him by thy bowels of tender compaſſion, and of pity to his poor Saints that are in want and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for thou mayeſt ſhew thy love to him in them. Chriſt looked with the eye of mercy upon thee, and did commiſerate thy wofull and diſtreſſed condition; he poured out the ſtreams of his moſt precious blood from all parts of his body, to waſh away the filth and the ſtaines of all thine iniquities, and haſt thou no ſparks of Charity for his poor diſtreſſed members?

Canſt thou ſee thy ſelf in proſperity, and not pity and relieve the ſervants of God that are in miſery? Think upon his nakedneſſe when he was upon the croſſe for thee, ?to aſſwage thy vainity in apparell, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

               <p>If thou injoyeſt thy liberty, think upon thy Saviours bonds, and caſt an eye of compaſſion upon his poor ſervants in the dungeon.</p>
               <p>If thou canſt make this good uſe of thy Meditations upon the paſſion and ſufferings of Chriſt, it is a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evidence, and a good aſſurance that Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, and that thou art of the number of thoſe whom he hath bought with his own blood, and whom he hath redeemed out of the priſon of eternall death.</p>

                  <hi>they compelled Simon a Cyrenian to bear his croſſe after him.</hi>

               <p>Now we may inlarge our Meditations upon the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of our ſweet Saviour, which do every hour increaſe upon him, and his deadly foes do ſtill add grief to his miſery, by laying his croſſe upon his tender back; yet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:118343:100"/> he did patiently bear it, though he was very ſenſible of the weight and burden of it, which was too heavy for his humane ſtrength, conſidering how much he was weakened This wooden Croſſe was but the ſhadow of that which did moſt preſſe him: for it was the wrath of God which was now poured out upon him, that was ſuch an unſupportable burden that his humane nature could not bear it without the power of his Deity to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aſſiſt him in it. <hi>Simon</hi> could help him bear this croſſe; but no creature, either man or Angel could help him bear the burden of Gods wrath for the guilt of our ſins, that was now charged upon him, which was ſo great and ſo heavy, that it made his knees to bow, his heart to faint, and his very ſoul to tremble: for he ſtood now before the Tribunal of Gods juſtice, as guilty of all manner of ſin, Original and actual, of Omiſſion and of Comiſſion: for the guilt of the fouleſt ſins of all the elect of God was imputed to him, and he was to ſatisfie the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for every ſin, great and ſmal before he could be eaſed of his ſorrowes, paines and torturings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could finiſh the work of our redemption, which God ſent him to do.

               <p>This croſſe is a fit reſemblance of all the troubles and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118343:101"/> ſorrowes that we ſhall meet with in this life: for it was heavy and troubleſome to bear. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt himſelf did bear it, he found the weight and trouble of it, and he was a man of ſorrowes, he was acquainted with grief, and he did feel the burden of our afflictions and tribulations, to make them eaſie to us, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our ſtrength. Secondly, becauſe it was ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy unto Chriſt, that he was ready to faint under it; whereby he did expreſſe in himſelf the weakneſſe and frailty of our nature: for if croſſes and tribulations preſſe hard upon us, we are ready naturally to repine, to caſt off all hope, and to ſink under the burden of them; and therefore Chriſt knowing by his own experience the weight of them, and our inabil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty to bear them with a contented patience, will comfort, ſupport, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us under them. Thirdly, that was a wooden croſſe, which was not for perpetuity, but continued onely for a time: to ſhew that our croſſes and ſorrowes continue not for ever: for God doth afflict us but for a ſhort time; but his loving kindneſſe and tender mercies to us continue for ever. Thus ſaith holy <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 30. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endureth but a moment, in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> Chriſt will not ſuffer us to faint under our troubles and miſeries; but will eaſe and refreſh us, as <hi>Simon</hi> eaſed him, when he was under the like condition. But if it be the will and pleaſure of God that the croſſe ſhall reſt upon us, and that afflictions ſhall follow us untill we have finiſhed our courſe in this life, death will then take it quite from us, and we ſhall never bear it any more, and we know not how ſoon that may be; alſo, it will open a door to us for our entrance into perfect bliſſe and happineſſe. <note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore we ſhould not faint, but though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory.</hi> Laſtly, God hath many wayes to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118343:101"/> help and eaſe us, when we are under the croſſe: for as he provided this ſtranger to bear the croſſe after him, becauſe none of his own nation had any pity on him; ſo likewiſe God will provide meanes for our comfort and ſuccour in our tribulations, beyond our expectation.

                     </gap>m for ſuch a time as this?</hi> Wherefore we may reſt upon God by faith in Chriſt for comfort or deliverance in all our neceſſities and dangers: for though our friends, or ſuch as have relation to us, do refuſe to help us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities; yet God will raiſe up ſtrangers for our comfort, and will ſend us meanes of deliverance which we little thought on.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us to bear meekly and patiently the croſſe that God doth lay upon us: for thereby we do ſhew our conformity with Chriſt, we follow his example and then he will give us grace to make an holy uſe of the croſſe to the glory of God, and to the comfort of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if we wait upon God with a ſtedfaſt hope, he will then give us a cheerfull heart under the croſſe, and a willing minde to bear it, untill he ſhall be pleaſed in his good time to remove it from us; which will be when it will make moſt for his own glory, and for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good.</p>
               <p>From hence we may draw true conſolation to our ſouls: for though Chriſt had more laid upon him than his humane ſtrength was able to bear; yet we ſhall not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118343:102"/> be overloaden with the burden of our croſſes, becauſe God hath committed the tempering of the cup of our afflictions to our Saviour Chriſt, who will ſhew his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion to us, though no humanity was ſhewed to him: he beſt knoweth what we are able to bear, and the ſharpneſſe of pain, ſmart, ſorrow of minde, and of any calamity whatſoever, but ſpecially he knoweth that we are not able to bear the anger and wrath of God for our ſins; and therefore he hath made an atonement between God and us by the merit of his blood, and hath alſo changed the nature of our croſſes and ſufferings by that which he hath ſuffered for us, and hath now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them for an holy and profitable end. For whereas in their own nature they are ſimply evill, and the puniſhments of ſin, and deſtructive to us, he hath ſanctified them, he hath taken out the ſting of evill that was in them, and hath changed them into fatherly chaſtiſements for the reformation of our ſinfull lives; ſo that whatſoever we ſuffer, though it be the due deſert of our ſins; yet it comes not now from Gods indignation and fury for our deſtruction, but from his fatherly love to correct and chaſtiſe us, as his children, to bring us to better obedience to his will, and that our ſouls may be ſaved in the day of his appearing. Alſo if our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are too ſharp, Chriſt will eaſe the ſmart with his ſupplying grace: for <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>he will be a preſent help to us in time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if God doth ſhew us any way to eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the croſſe to ſhun troubles, perſecutions, or the like, and if he doth afford us any lawfull meanes for our recovery out of pain or ſickneſſe, for our relief in want and ſcarſity, for our ſupport and comfort in tribulations and diſtreſſes, we are bound by the command of Chriſt to go that way for our ſafety, and to uſe the means which he hath appointed for our health, for our relief, and for our comfort in our miſeries.

                  <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and follow me.</hi> Alſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 14. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That through much tribulation we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Chriſt giveth this badge to ſome, for the tryal and the manifeſtation of his graces in them, that he may be glorified thereby: to others, for their humiliation, and to bring them to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118343:103"/> repentance for their ſinnes; he doth exerciſe others under the croſſe, to conform them unto himſelf in his ſufferings, and to make them bear it contentedly. Alſo he gives this badge to ſome to keep them from ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to prevent their backſlidings from God: for by theſe tryals and afflictions he doth alwayes intend the good of his ſervants, and not their hurt.</p>
               <p>Where this mark is truly imprinted, there will grace appear, and the fruits of it will break forth in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the will of God, in their faith and patience under afflictions, and in their rejoycing in the croſſe of Chriſt. This was the Apoſtles joy, <note n="r" place="margin">Acts 5. 41</note> 
                  <hi>that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame and rebuke for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> And this was <hi>Pauls</hi> glory: <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 6. 1</note> for ſaith he. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For ſuch is the tender and indulgent care of Chriſt toward thoſe that wear his livery, that though they are put into the fining pot of affliction, there to have their droſſe and corruptions purged and refined, yet he will not ſuffer them to receive any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby; but he will bring them forth purer gold than they were before.</p>
               <p>Wherefore learn to carry the croſſe of Chriſt in thy heart, expect it daily, and reſolve to bear it willingly, when God ſhall be pleaſed to lay it upon thee, and then thou wilt not feel it ſo heavie as it is in its own nature; alſo imprint the remembrance of his paſſion in thy minde, thereby to mortifie all thy worldly luſts and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſires, This cognizance will tell thee what inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance thou haſt in Chriſt, if thou doſt duly examine thy heart, when thou art under the croſſe, how thou haſt glorified God by thy faith and patience, how much thou art refined from thy corruptions, how much nearer thou art brought unto Chriſt in thine affections, to love him, to confide in him, to delight in the ſweet fruition of him, and to meditate on his goodneſſe and love to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118343:104"/> thee. If thou canſt finde ſuch fruits of thy croſſe, and that in the midſt of thy ſorrowes thou canſt ſay with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Job,</hi>

                  <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi> then be confident that Chriſt hath ſet his own ſtamp upon thy heart, he will know thee for his own, he will hide thee under the ſhadow of his wings, he will provide for thee in all thy neceſſities, and upon all occaſions, and all the powers of darkneſſe ſhall not be able to raiſe his ſtamp or the impreſſion of it out of thy heart, or to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate thee from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Mark further, and conſider it well, that there were ſome that followed Chriſt all that dolorous way to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> who could not refrain from teares and<note place="margin">
                     <hi rend="sup">u</hi> Luk. 23. 27, 28.</note> ſorrowfull ſobs; but bewailed him and lamented when they ſaw his dolefull and ſad condition, and they were chiefly women, to whom Jeſus turning ſaid, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves and for your children.</hi> Whereby he did graciouſly inſtruct them, how to fix their mourning upon the right object that their teares may proceed from a principle of grace; not to mourn for him, becauſe he did ſuffer no more than what was appointed by his heavenly Father, and he did bear it in obedience to his will: alſo, he did undertake no more than he was well able to undergoe, and no more could be laid upon him than was decreed in his Fathers counſell for the redemption of man. But Chriſt would have them weep and mourn for their ſins, which brought the wrath of God upon themſelves, and upon their children,: for there were grievous judgements, which would ſhortly come upon them. Alſo Chriſt did intimate to them, that their ſins, and the ſins of their children were a great part of the cauſe why he ſuffered ſuch contumelies, and ſo much cruelty, both by the Jews and by the Gentiles, that they might be freed from the guilt and from the puniſhment of them.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, that Chriſt doth give them two ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſons why they ſhould weep and mourn for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118343:104"/> and for their children. Firſt, becauſe of the great deſolation and finall deſtruction that was ſhortly after to come upon that famous and renowned City, and upon the whole nation of the Jews, wherein they and their children ſhould ſuffer very great calamities; therefore Chriſt did tell them, <note n="u" place="margin">Lu. 23. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the dayes were coming in which they ſhould ſay, bleſſed are the barren, and the wombes that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>And Chriſt himſelf wept for the miſery that was to come upon Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly Chriſt willeth them to reſerve their teares to lament and bewail their ſins, and the ſins of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; becauſe the great and terrible day of the general judgement was coming, when every one both high and low, great and ſmall, young and old muſt give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account to God of what they have done in the fleſh, either in thought word or deed, whether it be good or evill. <note n="y" place="margin">Iſa. 2. 19. Hoſ. 10. Luk. 23. 30</note> 
                  <hi>Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, fall on us, and to the hills cover us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus doth Chriſt direct us how to glorifie God with our teares, how to comfort our ſoul by our mourning, and how to be prepared for any common calamity, and alſo how to meet the day of judgewent with comfort, and that is by mourning for our ſins in time, and by making our peace with God by faith in Chriſt, with the teares of true repentance.</p>
               <p>Now take a view of thy teares and ſee from whence they flow; from an humane principle, or from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace: if thou canſt mourn for the evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which thou ſuffereſt, and canſt not mourn for the evill of the ſin which thou committeſt, thy teares are not then ſpent upon the right object; or if thou doſt weep &amp; grieve for thy ſins, and haſt no relation to Chriſt by faith in thy mourning, thou wilt have but little aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of pardon, and thou wilt find but ſmall comfort in thy weeping. Alſo if thou doſt lament and ſorrow for thy ſins, and not fully purpoſe and doſt endeavour to reform
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:118343:105"/> thy ſinfull life, thy repentance is not ſound, and thy ſorrow is not unto ſalvation. So likewiſe if nature can finde teares for the loſſe of ſome dear friend, or for any other worldly loſſes, and grace can find none to bewail thy ſelf, becauſe the light of Gods countenance is cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thee, or becauſe the Church of God is under afflictions and troubles, thou doſt then waſte thy teares to a wrong end. <note n="z" place="margin">Ezra. 10. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezra</hi> mourned for the tranſgreſſion of the people; <note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 1. 4.</note> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mourned for the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 230.</note> 
                  <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> Theſe teares proceeded from a Principle of grace, wherewith God was well pleaſed. And Chriſt doth here command us to reſerve our teares for general calamities; becauſe then God doth call for faſting, lamentation and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from thoſe eſpecially that are like to partake in ſuch calamities.</p>
               <p>If we can thus regulate our mourning, and thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our teares, it will make much for the glory of God and for the comfort of our own ſouls.</p>
               <p>But the conſideration of the dreadfull day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould moſt of all affect our hearts and ſoules with a godly ſorrow for our ſins, and with an holy and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to be reconciled unto God by faith in Chriſt, and to have a true aſſurance of the forgiveneſſe of them by our repentance, that we may then appear before God without any guilt of ſin upon our ſouls, and without the clamours and accuſations of an evill conſcience, and then it will be a day of rejoicing to us, and not a day of terrour. But if our ſouls are to appear with the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtains of ſin, and if our conſciences are ready to accuſe us, and to prefer a bill of indictment againſt us, that day will be moſt terrible and fearfull to us: for when we ſhall look upon the Judge, we ſhall ſee nothing in his countenance but terrour and fury, and we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing from him, but that dreadfull ſentence, of <hi>go ye curſed into everlaſting torments:</hi> on the contrary, if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118343:105"/> the grace of God hath taught us to deny ungodlineſs and<note place="margin">
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Tit. 2. 12. 13.</note> worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; we may then confidently look for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it concerneth us no leſs than the ſalvation of our ſouls, to make up our account while we live here, which we muſt then give unto God, even to an idle word; becauſe we ſhall be judged according to our works: for after this life is ended, there is no more faith to lay hold on Chriſt, no more hope of ſalvation, and no repentance for ſin. If our account be made up according to our own righteouſneſſe, it will come farre ſhort of that which God requireth, and he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; but if we can make it up in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, then whatſoever is wanting in us will be made perfect by his righteouſneſs in the ſight of God. How pittifull then and miſerable will the condition of unregenerate men be at that day? Who can make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their account, ſeeing they have no intereſt in Chriſt? And how can they ſtand before that great and dreadfull Judge, ſeeing he will not then know them? Wherefore we ſhould not neglect to make up our account thus with God every day; becauſe we know not how ſoon we are bereaved of time and grace for it, and the loſſe of one day may indanger our ſalvation. Loſe no time then and no opportunity for this great work of thy ſalvation, <note n="d" place="margin">2 Pet 1. 10.</note> but redeem the time which thou haſt loſt, by doubling thy future diligence to mak thy calling and election ſure.</p>

               <p>If it be ſo, that the eternall Son of God our bleſsed Redeemer ſuffered all kinde of ſhame and ignominy, blaſphemous words and cruell torments upon the croſſe, even to the pouring out of his very heart blood, to purge and cleanſe us from the guilt and from the filth of all our ſins, and that he ſuffered whatſoever the malice and power of the devill could inflict upon him, and alſo that for the time his Divine nature did refuſe to miniſter comfort to his humanity in theſe his bitter torments; what thankfulneſſe then do we ow to our dear Saviour for his wonderfull love to us? What can be too dear for him that did account nothing too dear for us? what duty, what reverence and fear do we ow unto him, who hath paid ſo great a price for our redemption? Our beſt expreſſions of love and duty are no way anſwerable to that which Chriſt hath deſerved, and which we are Sound to perform unto him; yet if they come from a willing minde and from a ſincere heart, Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will accept them, and out of his fulneſſe will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               <p>Here is much matter of heavenly comfort for us, if our hearts can devoutly Meditate upon it, and receive it.

If our ear is ſpiritually bored to hear thoſe dolefull and lamentable words which our Saviour uttered upon the croſſe, when he was ready to yeild up his Spirit to God his Father, and yet apply them to our ſelves by faith, we may then draw vertue and power from them to ſtrengthen our faith, and to ſupport our hope in the aſſurance of his love, that he will not bring us to ſo low a degree of ſpiritual deſertion,

               <p>If we are ingrafted into him by faith, we ſhall injoy him in his whole nature, as he is God and Man, we ſhall partake with him in all his excellencies and graces, he will work a new creation in us by his Spirit, and a thorough change in all the faculties of our ſouls, and in all the affections of our hearts, that no ſin ſhall cleave to our ſouls for our condemnation: for he will alſo nail the the guilt of all our ſins to his croſſe, upon which he ſhed his moſt precious blood to make an attonement for them all.

By the merit of Chriſts blood our ſins ſhall never be laid to our charge, by the power of his death we are made able to mortifie and kill the power of ſin in us, and the vertue of his reſurrection will quicken us up to newneſſe of life, and his righteouſneſſe will reſtore us to an higher degree of purity and holineſſe than we had in our firſt creation: <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> for <hi>by faith we are baptized into Chriſt, and have put on Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>But Chriſt did humble himſelf to the curſed death of the croſſe, and there his heart blood was poured out, which made his ſacrifice compleat and perfect.</hi>

               <p>If our dear Saviour was ſo mercifull to thoſe that brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hands in his blood, what heart can then conceive the riches of his mercy and love to his own ſervants, that love ſerve and obey him in truth, and with upright hearts? For mercy and tender love are eſſentially and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inherent in him, and there is no end of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to all thoſe that be long unto him; his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them goeth along in all his works: for if he doth correct them, it is in mercy for their good, he will not let the rod go out of his own hand: to ſome he doth but ſhake the rod, others feel but few ſtripes; and though ſome have many ſtripes, <note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 10. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>yet it ſhall be with judgment, not in his anger; he wil not deal with them according, to their ſins, nor reward them according to their iniquities, but his mercy will prevail, though his juſtice be provoked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore let no poor afflicted ſoul, that is under his rod, forbear coming unto Chriſt: for he can take off his viſitation when he pleaſeth, and he will pity him, as a Father pitieth his childe. Alſo let no poor ſinner that is truly humbled for his ſins, be afraid to have recourſe unto his Redeemer: for he prayed for ſuch, to procure their pardon, and to bring ſalvation to their ſouls. All the riches honours and pleaſures that the world affords, can give a ſinfull ſoul no true conſolation, if he be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and perplexed for his ſins; they are all miſerable comforters, when the guilt of ſin lieth upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: true comfort and fulneſſe of joy is to be found onely in Chriſt, and in him crucified: for he will take away the guilt of his ſins, that they ſhall not moleſt, or trouble his conſcience, he will help him bear his ſorrowes with a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118343:109"/> contented patience, he will ſtand by him, and intercede for him, that in his temptations and trials his faith may not fail him, <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 17 Iſa. 25. 8.</note> and at laſt he <hi>will wipe away all teares from his eyes.</hi> All this, and much more, Chriſt will do for us; for he will alſo ſtand for us againſt all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the devil, be they true or falſe; if they be true, he will preſent his own merits to his Father in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for us; if they be falſe, he will give the devil a ſhameful repulſe, and will curb him that he ſhall not hurt us: <note n="p" place="margin">1 John 2. 12.</note> for Chriſt Jeſus the righteous is our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father, and the propitiation for our ſins, and for the ſins of the whole world</p>
               <p>Conſider in the next place, that Chriſt did now put an end to the Ceremonial Law, for the types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows did ceaſe when he was ſlain, becauſe he was the ſubſtance of all thoſe ceremonies and ſacrifices. This was the laſt ceremonie which was to be fulfilled, <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 13. 11, 12.</note> that <hi>the bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe blood was to be brought into the Sanctuary by the High Prieſt for ſin, were burnt without the Camp.</hi> This Ceremony Chriſt fulfilled, <hi>when he ſhed his bloud without the gate, that he might ſanctifie the people with his own blood.</hi> For both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were now gathered together at Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where Chriſt died, that the people of all Nations might be ſanctified with his bloud, if they come unto him by faith to be cleanſed from the guilt of their ſinnes, and purified from their pollutions with his ſanctifying grace. Wherefore now, though we are aliens and ſtrangers to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet nothing hindereth, but that we may go forth boldly unto him, who finiſhed our redemption by his death without the gate, that thereby he might ſanctifie the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with his blood, as he did the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and therefore he will not refuſe us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly conſider, that <hi>Pilate</hi> did highly honour our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, when he wrote this Title to

                  <hi>Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the King of the Jewes;</hi> which was a title of great honour, and not of ſhame and diſgrace unto him. Their manner was to ſet up a ſuperſcription to ſhew the crimes why a malefactor was put to death; but <hi>Pilate</hi> could find no crime, and no fault in Chriſt, and therefore he wrote this ſuperſcription to clear his innocencie, and to brand the <hi>Jewes</hi> with perpetual ignominie and ſhame to all generations, for their malice and cruelty againſt him. For though <hi>Pilate</hi> did not believe that Chriſt was a King, and though he was perſwaded by the chief Prieſts, and by the people, to condemn him, and to put him to death; yet God would not ſuffer him to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by them to alter the Title, but to have it written in <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> that all Nations and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages might know the honour of his Perſon, and the horrible wickedneſs of the bloudy <hi>Jewes</hi> in killing their King, whom God had appointed and ſent to be their Saviour and Redeemer; alſo to make their name odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all people, as a juſt judgement of God upon them, becauſe they refuſed the ſweet tender of his grace and mercy, and killed his dear and onely Son. Chriſt was brought to the loweſt degree of his humiliation, and now God doth begin to glorifie him, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his honour and his great Name by the higheſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to all nations and people, and to the perpetual infamy and reproach of all his enemies to all poſterity. This honour was his due, and God would not ſuffer him to looſe it, and thus God will do for us alſo. If we are made the ſcorn of men, if we ſuffer perſecution, fire, ſword, or famine in a good cauſe, and if we die upon this croſſe, yet God will manifeſt the integrity of our hearts, and will give us that honour which is due to us, as his ſervants and his children: for if we drink of Chriſts bitter cup of ſorrows, we ſhall alſo drink of his pleaſant cup of joy and conſolation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou wilt have the meditations of thy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118343:110"/> heart upon the paſſion of thy dear and gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to be comfortable and profitable to thy ſoul, thou muſt not look upon him onely in that deſpicable condition, as he is now upon the croſſe to the outward eye; but with the eye of faith thou muſt look upon him, as he is the eternal Son of God, God and man, and as he is dignified with all his excellencies and titles of honour: for he was a Prophet, and ſuch a Prophet as did endow all the former Prophets with the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, whoſe Propheſies did chiefly concern him.</p>
               <p>Alſo he was a Prieſt after the higheſt order, whoſe Prieſthood was eternal, according to this of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 110. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent: Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe, he was a ſpiritual King to rule his Church, and in the hearts of all his elect, and he did ſubdue all his enemies under him, and he will alſo ſubdue all the enemies of his ſpiritual Kingdom in us.</p>
               <p>If thou canſt thus ſee the excellencies of Chriſt through his mean and contemptible condition, and if thou canſt believe that he is thy Redeemer, and all-ſufficient to be thy Saviour, it will inflame the affections of thy heart with intire love to him, becauſe he hath humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo low for thy ſake; it will make thee bend thine ear to his inſtructions; for he will teach thee heavenly wiſdom, and how to walk in the paths of godlineſſe; he will alſo preſent thy prayers, and all thy holy ſervices to God his Father, and then they ſhall be accepted; and this will alſo work a reverential fear in thee, to yeild all obedience to his commands: If thou doeſt thus look upon Chriſt, though he be upon the croſſe, it will give thee abundant comfort in thy ſufferings, exceeding much joy in the benefits which thou ſhalt have by his paſſion, and it will ſtirre thee up to a thankful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his goodneſs and mercie to thee.</p>

               <head>Who were the Agents in the Paſsion of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>VVE come now to conſider what Agents there were in this doleful tragedie of our Saviour Chriſt, how every one acted for his own ends, how God did make the deſignes of the devil, and of all his wicked inſtruments, to work for his own glorie; and how he did afterwards bring their wickedneſs upon their, own heads.</p>
               <p>The whole Paſſion of Chriſt, and every circumſtance of it was decreed from eternitie, and the three Perſons in the ſacred Trinity were the firſt and principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in this great work of Chriſts Paſſion: for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in the holy Trinitie ſhould be ſacrificed, and made a propitiation for the ſins of the world, which was done at Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time. For God the Father ſent him into the world for this end and purpoſe, and God the Son gave himſelf to be a ranſome for us, and aſſumed our nature, that he might fulfil all righteouſneſs, and ſuffer the whole penalty of the Law for us; alſo God the holie Ghoſt did give him all fulneſs of grace and power to bear the bitterneſs of his paſſion, and thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſin, death, hell, and the devil, and to give us power alſo over all the enemies of our ſalvation. Though God was the principal Agent in the crucifying of Chriſt; yet herein he had no evil intent or purpoſe, and therefore he was without ſin: for he had a gracious
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118343:111"/> and merciful end in it, that his juſtice might be ſatisfied for the ſin of man, and that the redemption and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his elect might be wrought by the precious bloud, and all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficient ſacrifice of his dear Son.</p>
               <p>But the devil was the chief actor in the wickedneſs, and crueltie of this ſad tragedie, whoſe end and deſign was to hinder our ſalvation by deſtroying our Saviour, and this he did ſeek to bring to paſſe by wicked means, and of malice to mankind; and therefore as ſoon as he had his permiſſion from God, he raiſed up his wicked inſtruments for his helliſh deſign.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <note n="a" place="margin">John 13. 27.</note> he entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> and took poſſeſſion there, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 25, 16.</note> who out of covetouſneſs ſold his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the chief Prieſts and Elders for thirtie pieces of ſilver, and ſought opportunitie to betray him unto them.</p>
               <p>Then he ſtirred up the chief Preiſts and Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who out of malice and envie did perſecute him, and falſlie accuſe him before <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people did ſo much reſort unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him out of fear and flattery to keep his grace and favour with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to pleaſe the people; for he thought he did it for <hi>Caeſars</hi> honour. The Souldiers crucified him for a reward, and to make a ſpoil of his garments.</p>
               <p>Thus they are all the devils inſtruments to put the immaculate Lamb of God to a moſt ſhameful and cruel death for their own wicked ends. But God did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule them all by his gracious and wiſe providence, and made all their purpoſes and actions to ſerve for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his moſt loving and merciful end, which was decreed from eternitie.</p>
               <p>From hence we may draw ſweet meditations for our comfort upon the power and goodneſs of God, who can and will over-rule the power of the devil, and of all wicked men, and will ſo diſpoſe of all their plots and devices, which they intend for the hurt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they ſhall all ſerve for his own glorie, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118343:111"/> for their good; he can fruſtrate their wicked intentions, and can bring about his own end, to effect his own work by them; God hath this provident care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that whatſoever their enemies do maliciouſly intend or deviſe againſt them ſhall be brought to nought, or elſe he will make it ſerve for their advantage and gain.

And though they be as cunning and as ſubtile <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam: 17</note> as <hi>Achitophel</hi> was, yet God can confound them in their own craft and policy.</p>
               <p>Mark now and conſider it well, how God in juſtice did revenge the treachery and cruelty that was uſed in betraying and in murthering of his dear and onely Son, and how he brought their wickedneſſe upon their own heads: for <hi>Judas</hi> was given up to a reprobate minde, <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 27 5</note> 
                  <hi>and immediatly after he hanged himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God did ſeverely puniſh the whole nation of the Jews for this moſt horrible fact, and laid the innocent blood of his Son upon them and upon their poſterity, which doth ſtil reſt upon them, becauſe they did wilfully without cauſe and out of malice ſhed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> alſo was ſoon after caſt out of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s favour, and baniſhed into <hi>France;</hi> and the Devil was hereby quite vanquiſhed and overcome; ſo that now he hath no power to hurt the meaneſt of Gods Saints. Thus will the Lord deal with all thoſe that have their hands ſtained with the blood of his Anointed ones, and with all ſuch as are Actors in any wicked Deſign: They may hide their counſels in the dark; yet nothing can be hidden from God: for he hath an All-ſeeing eye to diſcover what they go about, and he will bring the evill of their doings upon themſelves, or upon their children.</p>
               <p>Wherefore have thou no hand in the blood of Gods
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118343:112"/> ſervants, and partake not with the wicked in their evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: for the guilt of their ſins will cleave to thee, and God will not ſuffer it to go unpuniſhed: for if thou art partaker of other mens ſins, thou ſhalt alſo partake with them in their puniſhment: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 5. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth the <hi>Epheſians</hi> not to be partakers with wicked men, becauſe <hi>the wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience</hi> for their ſins. God calleth his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſaying, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Rev. 18. 4</note>

               <p>Now examine thy condition with a faithfull heart: art thou a malefactour and a grievous ſinner againſt God? Doth the guilt of thy ſins preſſe heavy upon thee? Doſt deſire from thy heart to be eaſed of that burden? Is the remembrance of them bitter unto thee, though it be when thou art weak and faint, and ready to give up the ghoſt? Then look up to Chriſt with the eye of Faith, confeſſe thy ſins unto him with a penitent heart, and if thine ear be ſpiritually opened, thou wilt then hear a gracious and mercifull anſwer from him to thy Petitions, and if thou wilt diligently ſearch the Scriptures, thou wilt find ſome promiſes of grace which will ſute with thy condition that Chriſt hath made to ſuch as thou art, which thou muſt apply to thy fainting ſoul by true faith, and ſtedfaſt hope that it belongeth unto thee; then reſt upon it with a firm confidence, to comfort thee in the aſſurance of thy reconciliation unto God, which will take away the evill of all thy ſorrowes, and the terrour of death it ſelf; which to a naturall man is moſt uncomfortable, and death is moſt fearfull and terrible to ſuch as ſee the hand-writing of God againſt them: for as they have lived in ſin without repentance; ſo they dye with the guilt of ſin upon their ſouls without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe.</p>
               <p>This Act of Chriſt in the converſion of this poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was extraordinary, and it was a ſpeciall work of mercy to manifeſt his power and goodneſſe to him, even

               <p>For it doth not appear that this man had ever any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, or any opportunity to come unto him, or any means of grace before this time, or that he did wittingly and wilfully defer the time of his ſalvation, or neglect the means of grace to the laſt hour, or deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſerve the hope of his Redemption to the time of his death. But though it were late before this Malefactor was converted, or had any true ſaving grace wrought in him, or before he did believe in Chriſt; yet his faith was true, <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 23. 41.</note> and he made a good confeſſion of his ſins, and did juſtifie the innocency of Chriſt in that inſtant of time when none of his friends durſt ſpeak in his cauſe, and his Apoſtles either doubted or ſeemed to ſtagger in their faith of his Divinity. Alſo, this mans converſion was at ſuch a time, as that he could neither be baptized, nor have further time for the amendment of his ſinfull life.</p>
               <p>Here is much matter of Spirituall comfort, if we duly conſider how powerfull true faith is to prevail with Chriſt in all our troubles, ſorrowes and neceſſities: for if we reſt and depend upon him, and if our hope and confidence be onely in him, let our condition of life be what it will, he will not deceive us in our hope, nor leave us without ſupport and comfort; alſo, if he findeth faith and truth in our hearts, he will deny us no good thing that we crave of him, be it never ſo great, or begged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo late: for this poor ſinner begged heavenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the very laſt hour of his life, when he had no time to expreſſe any thankfulneſs for ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118343:114"/> and yet he had his requeſt granted.</p>
               <p>But this particular Act of Chriſts mercy makes no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule for remiſſion of ſins to thoſe that do wilfully defer their repentance and turning to God to the laſt and worſt part of their lives: not that Chriſt is not alwayes ready to receive the truly humbled, and repenting ſinner, but becauſe late repentance is ſeldome ſound. God will not beſtow this heavenly grace at their pleaſure, who do willingly neglect the meanes of grace, and loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that God hath given them for it, and do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe to continue ſtill in their ſins, than to leave and forſake them, and to turn to the Lord with all their heart, and with all their ſoul.</p>
               <p>We cannot but dayly ſee what meanes the Lord uſeth to bring us unto Chriſt, and to make us get an holy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of our ſins through him by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: his Law doth ſhew us the deformity of our ſins, and what we have juſtly deſerved thereby, which is a forcible means to drive us unto Chriſt, by him to have Redemption from the curſe of the Law? the ſenſe of our ſins, and the anguiſh of our Spirits for them are ſtrong motives to make us ſeek to our crucified Redeemer, that they may be waſht away in his blood, which he ſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſmart of his rod in our troubles, ſorrowes and afflictions are ſpeciall means which God is pleaſed to uſe to bring us to repentance; but ſpecially if we finde by the manner of his viſitation, that it is for ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins which we have committed, we ought then ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent of them, and to ſeek after the blood of Chriſt, to apply it to our ſelves by faith, that the guilt of ſuch ſins may not cleave to our ſouls and conſciences, but that thoſe ſpiritual wounds which they have made in us may be quickly healed, before they come to putrid ſores and ulcers, and we may have a true aſſurance: hereof by our repentance.</p>
               <p>If repentance be truly wrought in us, there will be ſuch
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118343:114"/> an holy change in all the faculties of our ſouls, in all the affections of our hearts, and in all the parts of our bodies, that the corruptions of our Nature, and the ſinfull luſts of our fleſh will be mortified, and the power of ſin will be killed in us, that by the ſanctifying Grace of the holy Ghoſt we may be raiſed up to newneſſe of life</p>
               <p>If we did ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, we ſhould not keep at ſo farre a diſtance from Piety and vertue, and we ſhould not be ſuch ſtrangers to a Chriſtian life and converſation; but we would uſe all means to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nearer ſociety with Chriſt by true ſaving faith, and by heavenly contemplation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the ſpirituall dew of his heavenly graces may diſtill into our hearts to ſanctifie us throughout, both in ſoul and in body, that in Chriſt we may be made new creatures.</p>
               <p>To this end we muſt endeavour to keep our faith ſtill in action, and continually to uſe it upon all occaſions, and in every condition of life: for thereby we ſhall draw ſtrength and power from Chriſt to carry us on through all temptations and tryalls, and to ſupport and comfort us in all ſorrows and tribulations; it will purifie our hearts from dead works, and ſuffer no ſin to continue with us without repentance, to hinder the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>This rare example of the goodneſſe and mercy of Chriſt to this believing Thief, may keep us from deſpair, becauſe <note n="g" place="margin">Ezech. 18 21, 22.</note> there is mercy for a ſinfull ſoul, if at any time he doth truly repent, and turn to the Lord with a full intent and purpoſe of will to reform his evill, it doth alſo teach us not to be ſecure, or careleſſe of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it is extreamly dangerous to looſe any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of grace that God ſhall give us, or to take ſo much liberty to ſin as to forget to make our Peace with God in time: for we muſt give an account at the laſt day of all that we have done in the fleſh, and our condition then wil be moſt miſerable, if our reckoning be not made
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118343:115"/> perfect in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith while we live here upon earth, and therefore it is the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in this life to have no ſenſe of our ſpirituall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and not to fear or remember the dreadfull day of judgement. Alſo, this conſideration ſhould keep us from raſh judgement; and cenſuring of any mans condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he be a notorious ſinner: for God can give him grace to repent when he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>As this one example of the mercy of Chriſt to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner may keep us from deſpair, from ſecurity and from raſh judging of others; ſo let it keep us from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon ſin in hope of pardon; we do wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our repentance from day unto day, and ſo continue impenitent to the laſt part of our life, becauſe this man had all his ſins forgiven even in a moment, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy at the laſt hour: for God may juſtly deny us mercy, if we refuſe grace when the means is offered to us. So likewiſe let it keep us from preſuming upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe it is not in our power to repent when we will.</p>
               <p>This heavenly grace is the gift of God, and it is the firſt fruits of faith, which the holy Ghoſt will work in us, if we are ready to yield obedience to his holy inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to make the right uſe of ſuch meanes, as he is pleaſed to uſe, to make us willing to ſeek unto him for it: for if the Spirit of God doth not work it in us, we can have no hope ever to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Now conſider the ſtrength of faith that was in this poor ſinner, he gave the higheſt title of honour to Chriſt when he we was ſcornfully mocked, and in a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible condition to the eye of all men; he did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him and vindicate his honour when he was upon the croſſe, he did believe that heaven was his Kingdom, though he were now reviled and deſpiſed of all men, and that he had the diſpoſing of all honours and preferments in that Kingdom which made him pray unto him, <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome;</hi> alſo, his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118343:115"/> heart was touched with a ſenſible feeling of his ſins, he made a pious confeſſion of them, and therefore he did pray for mercy out of a true ſenſe of his miſery.</p>
               <p>If we can ſhew the faith of this penitent Thief, though our life hath been as vicious as his was, and though we turn to Chriſt late as he did; yet we may have good hope of the pardon of our ſins, and we may comfortably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his felicity, for Chriſt will return the like gracious anſwer to our Prayers, and the like promiſe of future happineſſe.</p>
               <p>But what faith can we ſhew if we ſtill diſhonour Chriſt with our words, and works? how can we truſt in him, if we do not believe that all regall power both in heaven and in earth is given unto him? And how can we hope for future bleſſedneſſe from him, if we are not confident that he is the diſpoſer of all the glorious manſions that are in heaven; what godly ſorrow have we for our ſins, if we ſtill go on in a preſumptuous way of ſinning? And what hope is there of true repentance if we ſtill cheriſh &amp; foſter our ſins in our boſome? if our faith and repentance be no better then thus, Chriſt will not hear our Prayers, nor grant our requeſts.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let not the devill delude thee with ſecurity or preſumption leſt he brings thee to perdition: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have periſhed with the ſhadow of this deceitful hope.</p>
               <p>Look well to the truth of thy faith, that it be well grounded upon the true knowledge of Chriſt, and of thoſe excellencies that are in him, that thou maiſt firmly reſt upon him in all troubleſome and dangerous times; but chiefly for the redemption of thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Neglect not the means of grace, and defer not thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: for God hateth ſuch as upon confidence of repentance in their old age, do preſume to ſin the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Conſider further how much this penitent ſinner was humbled in the ſenſe of his ſins, and of his unworthineſſe, and alſo how bountifull and good Chriſt was to him: for he durſt not preſume to beg any inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt; but onely ſome remembrance of him, when he came into his Kingdome; but Chriſt did grant him a preſent poſſeſſion of his Kingdome, <hi>Verily, I ſay, unto thee, To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Paradiſe was the place of bleſſedneſſe, where all the Saints of God ſhall be untill the generall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof the earthly Paradiſe was but a ſhadow. <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 16. 1. 1.</note> This bleſſed place is in the preſence of God, where we ſhall have fullneſſe of joy, and it is at Gods right hand, where there are pleaſures for evermore.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> Thus is Chriſt abundant in goodneſſe and in truth, if we have but little comfort in this ſhort time of our life, yet when we come to the end of our dayes we ſhall have fulneſſe of joy in the Paradiſe of God together with Chriſt our Saviour for evermore Wherefore though this life be full of vexations and troubles, the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hope of heavenly happineſſe, which we ſhall hereafter injoy to all eternity, will ſweeten the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our momentany afflictions and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Now comfort thy ſelf, O penitent ſinner, if thou art ſo caſt down in the apprehenſion of thy ſins, that thou dareſt not come into the preſence of God in regard of Divine juſtice, <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 18. 13.</note> or lift up thine eyes unto heaven with the poor Publicane, to crave what thou wanteſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt, becauſe thou haſt juſtly incurred his high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by thy manifold tranſgreſſions; yet be not diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118343:116"/> faint not, but come cheerfully to Chriſt with true faith, and firm confidence to be received: for he will open a Fountain to thee from whence all Divine mercy floweth, and thou wilt find him alwayes ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of thee: make thy condition therefore truly known unto him, put up thy prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, and though thou deſireſt but a drop of comfort; yet he will give thee abundant conſolation in what thou ſuffereſt, and much more than thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>By the example of this Malefactor, we may draw ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meditations upon the Divine Nature of true faith for our inſtruction and comfort: for it looketh beyond the eye of reaſon, and above the reach of nature, it maketh us evidently to apprehend that which our reaſon or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall capacity cannot ſhew us, and it will make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in hope, even againſt hope, that which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nature, and incredible to humane reaſon. This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinner had no reaſon to believe in Chriſt, and to confide in him for his ſalvation: for we do not read that ever he heard his preaching, or ſaw any of his miracles; but he ſaw him now ready to dye an ignominious and curſed death upon the croſſe, and he heard him thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 27. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou be the Son of God come down from the croſſe.</hi> Alſo, he heard him mocked in this manner by the chief Prieſts and Elders, <hi>He ſaved others himſelf he cannot ſave: if he be the King of Iſrael let him come down from the croſſe, and we will believe in him; He truſted in God, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him now, if he will have him: for he ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though theſe and the like blaſphemous words were ſpoken in deriſion againſt him, which were ſufficient in all reaſon to keep back this Malefactor from truſting in him; yet the holy Ghoſt did ſo work upon his heart, that he did faithfully believe that Chriſt was the Son of God, that he was the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he had ſaved others, and therefore he could ſave him alſo, which made
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118343:117"/> him to apply himſelf to Chriſt for comfort, and for his ſalvation, and in his addreſſes to him, he came with all modeſty and humble ſubmiſſion, he gave him all due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence, as much as he was then able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and then he made this humble ſuite and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him: and no ſooner was his requeſt made but it was granted, becauſe Chriſt did ſee truth and ſincerity in his heart, and integriry in his expreſſions.</p>
               <p>We may obſerve from hence for our inſtruction and conſolation, that the holy Ghoſt can work the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſinner, either without meanes, or by contrary meanes, he doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes work very ſtrangely upon the will and upon the affections of the heart: for Chriſt was now preached by his deadly foes out of ſcorn and mockery; <note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 1 15</note> as there were ſome in <hi>Pauls</hi> time that did preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife; others of love and good will; yet the Spirit of God did ſo enlighten the underſtanding of this ſinfull man, and did ſo work upon his will, and ſo ſeaſoned his heart with ſaving grace, that he received holy inſtruction thereby, and what the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt did ſpeak in his diſgrace, he did apply it to himſelf, to confirm him in the truth of his Divinity, which made him ſtick cloſe to him by faith, when he was in the loweſt degree of his humiliation: his faith made him reſt upon Chriſt and upon his promiſe above the ſtrength of nature, and contrary to all humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>If he had ſeen the glory of Chriſt in his tranſfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and if he had ſeen ſome of his great miracles, or had heard his Divine Doctrine, and powerful Preaching, his faith had not ſeemed ſo great; but now he did ſee him onely upon Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> nailed to his croſſe, as the worſt of Malefactors are, and rejected of his own nation; ſo that to the outward eye he appeared nothing elſe, but a pitiful ſpectacle of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſery; and yet this penitent ſinner did expreſſe an admirable faith in the pangs of a cruell and violent death,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118343:117"/> though his faults had been intolerable in his diſſolute life: for nothing but faith could move him to honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Chriſt; now he was in this ſad condition, and to ſue unto him to be remembred in his Kingdome. By the eye of his faith he did ſee in Chriſt more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane meekneſſe and patience in his ſufferings, undaunted courage above the ſtrength of nature, to go thorough with all conſtancy thoſe torturings and torments, which with all cruelty and malice were inflicted upon him: and he did ſee ſome glympſe of Divine mercy in him, when he heard him pray ſo graciouſly for his perſecutors, and tormentors, and for thoſe that put him to death.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, ponder well in thy heart upon the mercifull anſwer of Chriſt to this penitent Malefactor, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee, To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> whereby he did ſhew his power to forgive ſins upon earth.</p>

               <p>Conſider alſo, that Chriſt did preſently grant his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and did ſuddenly perform his promiſe: for God doth ſometimes anſwer the deſires of our hearts before we ſpeak, and he will give what we need before we ask.

               <p>But ſometimes it is long before we have a return of our prayers, becauſe God will try our patience, and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in waiting his good pleaſure, and by his delayes to make us more fervent in our ſupplications: for he loves an holy importunity.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118343:119"/> they are to encounter with any hard tryall, and he will give them heavenly comforts for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſuffer any ſorrowes or afflictions for his ſake: for they are all as dear unto him as his Mother was. Wherefore if we are in any diſtreſſe, or put upon any ſervice which is above the ſtrength of nature, we muſt look upon the Almighty power of Chriſt with the eye of Faith, as he is God as well as Man, and upon his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tender love to all his ſervants, and alſo upon Gods eternall decree and wiſe providence, that nothing can be impoſed upon us, but what was preordained &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by God himſelf for his own glory, and then Chriſt our bleſſed Redeemer will fit us for it: and if it be too hard for us to undergo, he will direct and aſſiſt us with his Spirit in it; alſo, if the burden be too heavy for our ſtrength to bear, he will either leſſen the burden, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our ſtrength, or elſe he will act the part of the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> and take it off from us in his good time.</p>
               <p>The beſt of Gods ſervants can claim no Priviledge from croſſes, ſorrowes and afflictions in this life: for they muſt paſſe thorough many tribulations, before they come to their eternall reſt in heaven.</p>
               <p>God hath many gracious ends in ſuffering his ſervants to be tempted, to be tryed, to be buffeted and afflicted; and whatſoever the inſtruments which he uſeth do intend againſt them; yet he will fruſtrate their wicked deſignes, and will effect his own work for his own glory, and for their good.</p>

Wherefore we muſt not meaſure the love of God by the outward bleſſings which we injoy, nor his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the croſſes which we ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, that none could ever claim greater priviledge from afflictions and ſorrowes, than the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and none was ever more to be honoured upon earth than ſhe: for ſhe did bear Chriſt the only Son of the eternal God in her bleſſed womb, who had the command of all creatures in heaven and in earth, and who was the fountain of all true conſolation, and ſhe injoyed the comfort of his ſacred ſociety many years, and yet ſhe had her cares, ſhe had her ſorrowes, her whole life was full of afflictions, wants and neceſſities, ſhe was put to great extremities when Chriſt was born, ſoon after ſhe fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> for the ſafety of her Sons life, ſhe loſt him three dayes at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and at that time ſhe ſought him with a ſorrowfull heart.</p>
               <p>But above all behold and ſee how her ſoul is now pierced thorough with grief: for ſhe muſt now loſe his gracious company for ever, ſhe now beholds him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118343:120"/> upon the Croſſe, ſhe ſeeth how his tender body is rent and torn with the thornes, and with the whip, how his hands and feet are nailed to the Croſſe, as if he had been a notorious malefactor, and ſhe hears the revilings and blaſphemies that were uttered againſt him in a moſt ſhameful &amp; ſpiteful manner, which was enough to break her ſorrowfull heart; but eſpecially ſhe did ſee his very heart blood guſh out of his ſide, which was pierced with a ſpear. This was the wofull and lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the bleſſed Virgin at this time; but Chriſt gave her inward comfort and ſtrength of faith anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the greatneſſe of her ſorrowes, which did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her heart from fainting, and her ſoul from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>This may be the condition of any of Gods ſervants, they may be oppreſſed and preſſed down with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miſeries, they may drink deep in the bitterneſſe of them; but yet they are freed from the curſe that was upon them, and there is nothing in them to hurt their ſouls; for that is taken away by theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, which makes the burden of them more eaſie, that they may bear it with a willing minde.</p>
               <p>When our afflictions are thus ſanctified, we ſhall find the fruit and benefit that comes thereby to be very ſweet and profitable, ſo that we ſhall have good cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice under them: for as our ſorrowes and ſufferings do abound; <hi>ſo alſo grace ſhall ſuperabound,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider yet further, that as the holy Virgin was continually exerciſed under the Croſſe, and had her ſhare in common calamities; ſo likewiſe ſhe had her particular cares of want and ſcarcity: for her condition of life was but mean, and her livelihood was but ſmall: therefore ſhe was now like to be left deſtitute of all comfort, relief and ſuccour. But Chriſt her beloved Son takes care of her, he provides as well for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118343:120"/> of her body, as for the comfort of her ſoul, and commends her to <hi>John</hi> his beloved Diſciple. <note n="m" place="margin">John 19. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſaith he, to his Mother, <hi>behold thy Son,</hi> and to <hi>John</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Behold thy Mother.</hi> And from that hour <hi>John</hi> took her unto his own home, and provided for her during her life.</p>
               <p>Thus was the bleſſed Virgin trained up in the ſchool of affliction and ſorrow, to keep her from ſpirituall pride, though ſhe were honoured and bleſſed above all other women; and that her minde ſhould not be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen away after the pomp and vanitis of the world, but ſtill to bear Chriſt in her heart, as ſometimes ſhe did bear him in her wombe. It was alſo to free her from all earthly cares, that the meditations of her heart might be alwayes heavenly, and that the deſire of her ſoul might be to be with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This care Chriſt will have to provide whatſoever is needfull for all thoſe that belong unto him: for he beſt knoweth what is good for us, and he will not ſuffer us to want, if we put our truſt in him. We need not carke and care for the tranſitory things of this life, which are given to the wicked as well as to the godly: We need not diſtruſt the wiſe Providence of God; but we may confidently reſt upon Chriſt: for he will ſupport and comfort us in our tribulations, and will provide for us in our wants and neceſſities: troubles and ſorrowes may come upon us, loſſe of Parents, Children, or Friends will come, and caſualties may happen in our eſtate, which we would neither foreſee nor prevent: theſe and the like will imbitter all the comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that we can finde in this world; but if we belong unto Chriſt, we ſhall never loſe him, neither can any thing bereave us of the ſweet conſolation that we ſhall finde in him.</p>
               <p>This we may believe to be true, that our croſſes and ſufferings in this life may be better for us then to injoy all earthly pleaſures and delights. <hi>Moſes refuſeth to

               <p>Now we muſt learn how to draw true conſolation to our ſouls from this eternal Fountain of comfort, when outward calamities or anguiſh of ſpirit doth overpreſſe us. Our worldly preferments, our natural endowments, humane learning, or common grace cannot reach this Fountain, the well is deep, and nothing can reach it but true Faith, which is the onely bucket to draw this water of comfort from Chriſt, which will refreſh our ſouls when they are thirſty and dry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heaven will then ſmile upon us, though the world frownes; the inward man will feel comfort and conſolation, though the outward man be miſerably tortured and tormented with the vexations, and miſeries that are incident to this life.

No darts of Satan can be ſo fiery againſt a poor ſinner, but this blood can quench them, no wound can be ſo deadly, or ſo deep in the ſoul, but this blood can ſearch it, and cure it, if it be rightly applyed by Faith, whereof we may have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſurance by our repentance and newneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>Wherefore here is much comfort for a poor languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, that is doubtful of the pardon of his ſins, if his Faith can perſwade him that Chriſt Jeſus was crucified for him, and that this Fountain was opened for his cure: for without this holy perſwaſion nothing can truly comfort us in our ſpirituall afflictions.</p>
               <p>Faith will give us this holy aſſurance, if by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power thereof we can ſay with holy <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 6. 14</note> 
                  <hi>By the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby we have power to mortifie our evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and all our ſinful luſts, that they may have no dominion over us, to lead us captive unto deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly we may learn by the Example of our bleſſed Saviour, that it is a pious duty which God requireth, for children to provide for their needy, or aged parents according to their ability, both in their life and at their death; and this is part of that thankfulneſſe, which they ow to their parents, and which God hath commanded them to perform: for next under God we ow our ſelves, and whatſoever we have unto them; we had our being, our breeding, and our education from them; can any expreſſion of thankfulneſſe then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118343:122"/> be too much for them? If God hath bleſſed us with plenty and with increaſe, it was for our parents ſakes, to relieve and ſuccour them in their age, and in their neceſſity; or elſe it was becauſe they were faithfull to God in his worſhip and ſervice, and therefore God hath poured down his bleſſings upon us their children, as it hath been his uſuall cuſtome ſo to do. Wherefore if God hath dealt bountifully with us, and but ſparingly with our parents, we are both bound by the Law of God, and by the law of nature, to ſupply their wants accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our power.</p>
               <p>As God hath communicated ſome part of his own honour to our Parents, by giving them the Title of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to preſerve the preheminence which he hath given them over their children; ſo he hath bound the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a ſtrict command to honour their Parents, and to expreſſe it by their reverence, obedience and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to them for what they have received from them which they cannot perform as they ought, if they do withdraw any thing from their due honour, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or their helping hand from them in their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Children are not bound thus to honour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents onely in their minority, or ſo long as they are under their tuition and government: for the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God doth not limit it to theſe times; but it gives the Father &amp; the Mother this honor ſo long as they have any child living; and there is a promiſe of a great bleſſing annexed to this Commandement. Children may come to be greater in worldly honours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments then their Parents; and yet they have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge againſt this Command of God. Thus ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Children, obey your Parents in the Lord: for this is right:</hi> and then he citeth Gods Commandement which bindes them to this obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 2. 51.</note> Chriſt himſelf was ſubject to his Parents, untill his heavenly Fathers buſineſſe called him away, and now at his death he takes order for his Mothers maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118343:122"/> Wherefore, if children do thus expreſſe their thankfulneſſe to their Parents, and do thus honour and obey them according to the Example of Chriſt; then God will provide for them and their children, and will perform his promiſe of long life, and of bleſſings, both temporall and eternall: on the contrary, God will curſe the children that diſhonour their Parents, and are in this kind unthankfull to them, both in this life and in the life to come.</p>

               <p>Conſider yet further, how the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did mourn to ſee the King of glory thus abaſed, to ſee the ignominy and diſgrace that was caſt upon him,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118343:124"/> how cruelly he was uſed, and how unjuſtly he was put to death. This ſhould teach us to mourn for the calamities of the Church of God, &amp; for the loſs of any pillar in that ſpirituall building. We have many examples of the ſervants of God for this pious duty; <hi>Jeremiah, Ezrah, Nehemiah,</hi> and others mourned and lamented greatly for the firſt deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 19. 41, 42, 43.</note> Chriſt himſelf wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he beheld it, becauſe he knew the finall deſtruction that ſhould ſhortly after come upon it. When <hi>Eliſha</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi rend="sup">l</hi> 2 King. 13. 14.</note> the Prophet was fallen ſick of the ſickneſſe whereof he dyed, <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King of Iſrael came down unto him, and wept over his face and ſaid, <hi>O my Father, my Father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a full expreſſion of the grief and ſorrow of his heart for the loſſe of ſo great a Prophet, who was a ſtrong Pillar in the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider alſo that if there be no mourning, and no tears for the ſins of a nation, or people, God will make the heavens to mourn, and the clouds to pour down rivers of tears, to teach us what we ſhould do, when the land is over-grown with the weeds of ſin.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, that the ſervants of God do mourn for the miſeries that his Church doth ſuffer, and for the loſſe or pulling down of any poliſhed ſtone in that heavenly building; then whoſe ſervants are they, and what maſter do they ſerve, that diſmember the myſticall body of Chriſt, that pull down any Pillar of his Church, or pull any poliſhed ſtone out of his ſpirituall Temple, whereby it may be in danger of ruine, or to fall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay? Alſo, they are in a ſad condition, that pollute, deface, or throw down his materiall temples, to the diſhonour of his Name, to the ſuppreſſing of his true worſhip and ſervice, and to bring in ſects and ſchiſmes, profaneneſſe and ſuperſtition. God will not ſuffer ſuch inſtruments of wickedneſſe to go unpuniſhed; but in his due Time he will make them examples of his fury, if
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118343:124"/> they do not ſincerely repent of their crying ſins, and curſed abominations.</p>
               <p>By this ſtrange darkneſſe of the Sun we may alſo learn how uncomfortable it is to a childe of God, to have the light of his Countenance clouded from him. <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 30. 7</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> was much troubled when God did hide his Face from him.</p>
               <p>How was Chriſt himſelf perplexed in his ſoul, when the light of Gods countenance was withdrawen from him? It made him cry out in the bitterneſſe of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> As it is the greateſt bleſſedneſſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thou haſte made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</hi> Alſo, thus he prayeth, <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6.</note>

               </p>
               <p>It doth likewiſe teach us what a great puniſhment it is when the Miniſters of God are removed from their places, and the people fit in darkneſſe, and left to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſpirituall blindneſſe, or elſe to ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as cannot ſhew them the right way to heavenly happineſſe. But it is a puniſhment above all other, when God will take away his Word and Goſpel from a Nation, or people; becauſe they deſpiſe it, and will not learn inſtruction by it.</p>
               <p>Chriſt thus threatneth the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Rev. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and I will remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi> Darkneſſe of underſtanding was one of the curſes which God threatned to bring upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they would not obey his Law. <note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 28. 28, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee with blindneſſe, and thou ſhalt grope at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, as the blinde gropeth in darkneſſe, and thou ſhalt not proſper in thy wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the ſins of the Jews which the Prophet rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:118343:125"/> up, this was one, <note n="r" place="margin">Iſa. 59. 7, 9, 10.</note> that <hi>they made haſte to ſhed</hi> innocent blood; <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is judgement far from us, neither doth juſtice overtake us: We wait for light, but behold obſcurity; for brightneſſe, but we walk in darkneſſe. We grope for the wall like the blinde; and we grope as if we had no eyes: We ſtumble at noonday, as in the night, we are in deſolate places as dead men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this was truly verified in the <hi>Jews</hi> at this time, when they ſhed the innocent blood of our Saviour Chriſt upon the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a fearfull judgement, when God doth bereave us of the means of knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his will. Hear what the Lord threatneth by his Prophet. <note n="ſ" place="margin">Amos 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they ſhall wander from ſea to ſea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the Word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſerable are the people that are in ſuch a caſe: for they have no means to come to the knowledge of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, by whom they muſt be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Now let us Meditate with faithfull hearts on the wonderfull goodneſſe of God, who hath continued ſtill unto us the light of his Goſpel, and his Word of truth, to be a Lanthorn to our feet, and a light unto our paths, and to guide us into the way of true peace and heavenly felicity, whereas our ſins have juſtly deſerved that he ſhould remove our Candleſtick from us. Let us alſo ſtudy all thankfulneſſe to him for ſo great a bleſſing, and labour to improve it to the glory of God, and to the edification of our ſouls to eternall life. <note n="t" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 1</note> In the dayes of the Judges untill <hi>Samuels</hi> time the Word of the Lord was precious; there was no open viſion. Wherefore, while we do injoy it we ſhould highly prize it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with pure affections, as the means which God hath appointed for our ſalvation.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:118343:125"/>
               <p>In the laſt place conſider, that as it was the good pleaſure of God to humble his onely Son ſo low before he had finiſhed the work of our redemption, as that the Sun ſeemed to mourn at the ſight of it: ſo likewiſe God is ſometimes pleaſed to bring his deareſt ſervants from the higheſt degree of honour to the loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men for ſome end and purpoſe, which he in his ſecret wiſdom doth intend, either for his own glory, or for their good. It may be our caſe to be brought from plenty to penury, from pleaſure to pain, from health to ſickneſſe, from credit and honour to ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; but we need not repine at Gods Providence herein: for as he can advance his own glory by our condition, how mean ſoever it be; ſo he can and will ſanctifie our condition to our comfort, and for our good, though it be among the loweſt degrees of men, if we do meekly ſubmit to his will and pleaſure. We cannot be brought ſo low as our gracious Saviour was, we cannot ſuffer ſo much of Gods fury as he did: for he drank a full draught, and the very dregs of the cup of trembling at Gods hand; but we have a very ſmall portion meaſured out to us, and the bitterneſſe of it will ſoon be out of our taſté: <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 30. 5.</note> for <hi>the anger of Goden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but a moment, in his favour is life; wé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Chriſt hath had full experience of our ſorrowes, and he will compaſſionate us in our miſeries.

               <head>Of the Death of our <hi>SAVIOUR CHRIST.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COnſider now with all pious devotion, to what weakneſſe both of ſpirit and body our dear and precious Saviour was brought, when he was upon the Croſſe: for his blood was waſted, his Spirits were ſpent, the moiſture of his body was dryed up, and the time of his diſſolution was now at hand.</p>
               <p>Now was fulfilled that of the Prophet, <note n="a" place="margin">Zech. 13. 7</note> 
                  <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: ſmite the ſhepherd and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> When Chriſt was in this extremity of weakneſſe a little before his death, <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 19. 28.</note> he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> by all which he did ſhew the truth of his humanity. This thirſt was not ſo much for wine, or water to refreſh his fainting ſpirits, as it was to have our redemption fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that God might be glorified in the ſalvation of mankinde. Then the barbarous people that had no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in them, gave him Vinegar in a ſpunge to drink, which they did out of malice to increaſe his pain and miſery; but the Lord did ſo order it, that it was to fulfill this ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 69. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>They gave me alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me Vinegar to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">d Joh. 19. 30</note> 
                  <hi>drink.</hi> When Chriſt had taſted it, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> becauſe all the Propheſies were then fulfilled that were ſpoken of him in his life. <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Then he commended his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the hands of his Father, and gave up the Ghoſt:</hi> As this Lamb of God lived in perfect innocency, ſo he dyed in perfect meekneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:118343:126"/>
               <p>Then preſently after <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 19. 34</note> 
                  <hi>one of the ſouldiers pierced his ſide with a ſpear to his very heart, and forthwith c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>They ſhal look on him whom they pierced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was alſo done that we might faithfully believe the truth of his death. This is a ſpeciall Article of our Faith, which we muſt ſtedfaſtly believe, if we will have comfort in the aſſurance of our redemption: for if Chriſt had not truly dyed, the juſtice of God had not been fully ſatisfied for our ſins, we could have had no power to dye unto ſin, or to mortifie our corruptions and ſinfull luſts, and death would be moſt bitter, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and terrible to us. If Chriſt had not dyed and roſe again, how could death have been deſtroyed? How could the ſting of death be taken out? Who ſhould have ſanctified death unto us? And how could we be willing to imbrace it? Wherefore if we do truly believe the death of Chriſt, and that he dyed for us, it will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter much matter of exceeding great conſolation to our ſouls at the hour of our diſſolution.</p>
               <p>From the former conſiderations we may draw much comfortable matter for our hearts to meditate upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt it doth evidently appear that our Saviour Chriſt did aſſume to his Deity our whole nature, ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which did ſtill retain all the properties of humane nature, unconfounded with his Deity: <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 2. 17</note> 
                  <hi>He was like unto us in all things,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Heb 4. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>ſin onely excepted.</hi> His ſoul was ſenſible of grief and ſorrow; his body did feel the ſmart of pain, he was ſubject to all our naturall paſſions and infirmities, which may be without ſin; he was ſenſible of hunger, thirſt, wearineſſe and the like: he was alſo ſubject to mortality, though not to corruption: for, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 16. 10</note> 
                  <hi>God would not ſuffer his holy One to ſee corruption;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no ſpot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſtain of ſin in him, and there was a true diſſolution of his ſoul from his body when he dyed.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt had not aſſumed our whole nature, he could
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:118343:127"/> not have perfectly ſaved and redeemed us, ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and then the work, which God ſent him to do, had not been finiſhed, but we had ſtill remained in our ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 10</note> But the whole work of our Redemption was fully wrought by that which he ſuffered, both in his ſoul and in his body, to give us an holy aſſurance that we are freed from the guilt of ſin here, and ſaved from the condemning power of ſin hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may learn from thence this inſtruction, ſo to regulate our thirſty deſires, that they may be for the glory of God, and not for own ſinfull ends. If we thirſt after the things of this world for any other end, than for the honour of God; our thirſt is ſinful, and it will be ſatisfied with vinegar, or gal; and if we thirſt after blood, rapine or revenge, the end of theſe and the like thirſty deſires will be the death of our ſouls. But if our thirſt be holy and heavenly, we ſhall then have thirſty deſires and holy endeavours <note n="m" place="margin">Iſal. 613.</note> how to injoy God, and to do his will, how to preſerve our neighbours ſafety, and how to keep our ſelves undefiled; and if we can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 143. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſoul thirſteth after thee, O Lord, as a thirſty land:</hi> then our thirſt ſhall be quenched, and our ſouls ſhall be refreſhed with the ſweet comforts of God. Alſo, if we thirſt after Chriſt Jeſus, who is the chief honour of a Chriſtian, and after grace and godlineſſe, which are the true riches of the ſoul; then Chriſt will be a fountain of living water to us, which onely can quench our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall<note place="margin">
                     <hi rend="sup">o</hi> Joh. 4. 10.</note> thirſt, and refreſh our panting ſouls, and it ſhall ſpring up in us to everlaſting life. Chriſt calleth every one to drink of this water. <note n="p" place="margin">John 7. 37</note> 
                  <hi>Iſ any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink:</hi> Thus ſaith the Prophet, <note n="q" place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and ye that have no ſilver, come, buy and eat; come, I ſay, buy wine and milk without ſilver and without money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Chriſt offereth himſelf and his graces freely: But to whom? It is onely to ſuch as have a ſpiritual thirſt after him. Wherefore if this be the thirſt of our ſouls
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118343:127"/> to injoy Chriſt, and him crucified, we ſhall ſee ſuch a Fountain of water of life flow out of his bleſſed fide, as will purifie our hearts from all ſin, and cleanſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from all iniquity, whereby our thirſty ſouls will be more comforted and refreſhed, than our bodies can be by any Fountain of Water in our naturall thirſt. <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 42.</note> This holy thirſt made <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul pant more after God, than the <hi>Hart panteth after the water-brooks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, from this conſideration that Chriſt had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar given him in a ſpunge, we may learn this profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Doctrine, that there is no content nor ſtability in any earthly thing, for though we ſhould injoy all the contentment that the world can give us; yet it will not ſatisfie our deſires, ſomething will be wanting, and we ſhall ſtill thirſt after more, and we ſhall finde ſoureneſs and bitterneſſe in the beſt of earthly things. Alſo, that which we do poſſeſſe, we have it but in a ſpunge, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den caſualty by fire, or water, a word ſpoken againſt King, or State will wring it out, a little pain or ſickneſs a little trouble or ſorrow will ſoon blaſte the comfort of of it, and make it like vinegar to our taſte. If we ſhould meet with nothing to imbitter, or blaſt our earthly joyes, yet in their own nature they are tranſitory and unſtable, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eccl. 12. 1.</note> and when old age cometh, we ſhall take no pleaſure in them, and death will quite bereave us of them all. Now then if we put our truſt in theſe vain things they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and will give us no ſolide comfort, except we do injoy them in Chriſt: for without him the beſt of all earthly bleſſings are but vanity and vexation of Spirit. Wherefore let this be our greateſt care, our chiefeſt joy, and the deſire of our ſouls to injoy Chriſt, to be joyned unto him with the bond of faith and love; and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our eſtate or condition be. we ſhall finde comfort in it, we ſhall injoy it with a good conſcience, we ſhall glorifie God with it, and if we do caſually loſe it, we ſhall loſe nothing by it: for we ſhall ſtill injoy Chriſt, who will abundantly recompenſe our earthly loſſes with
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:118343:128"/> ſpirituall comforts here, and with an eternall inheritance hereafter,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when death comes near to us, we have moſt need of the beſt comforts, both for ſoul and body that we may the more ſtrongly encounter with this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible enemy in the diſſolution of our ſouls from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but Chriſt at this time had ſoure vinegar given him, which could no way comfort him; but rather aggravate his pains and ſorrowes, when he was every way in great extremity.</p>
               <p>This doth fitly reſemble the caſe of many of Gods dear ſervants: for they are often troubled and perplexed with many fears, doubtings, temptations, and evil ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the devil, when they are to enter into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combate with death it ſelf: for then he will lay their ſins before them with all the aggravations that may be, and he will labour to hide the mercies of God in Chriſt from them, that they might have no hope, or comfort to ſupport them in this great conflict, which doth put them into trouble of minde, grief of heart, and anguiſh of ſpirit, and it is more uncomfortable and unpleaſing to their ſpirituall taſte, than any vinegar can be to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Then is the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Divell is moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bent againſt them, then doth he beſtirre himſelf, to trouble the Peace of their conſciences, to diſquiet the tranquillity of their mindes, and to keep them from the aſſurance of the love and favour of God to them in Chriſt, that they ſhould not comfortably reſign up their ſouls unto God: he will affright them with the fear of death, with the greatneſſe of their ſins, with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of their hearts, with their infidelity and unbelief, he will labour to keep the gracious promiſes of God from them, or elſe to perſwade them that they belong not unto them, that ſo they ſhould have no comfortable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the pardon of their ſins. Alſo he will terrifie them with the fear of Gods juſtice, and with the terrour of the dreadfull day of judgement, if it were poſſible, to drive them into deſpair.</p>

               <p>But here is comfort for a poor ſinner, that it is thus aſſaulted by the Divel, when he is near his departure out of this life, or at any other time; that Chriſt hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all theſe ſorrowes and conflicts to him, and he will confirm his faith, and ſtabliſh his hope upon his true humiliation for his ſins; and then thoſe fears and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will vaniſh away; for he knoweth that we are not able to reſiſt ſuch temptations, and the weakneſſe of our ſpirits, and of body is ſuch, that we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch ſtrong aſſaults, and therefore Chriſt will give moſt ſtrength to our inward man, when the outward man is moſt weak, and he will moſt weaken the power of the Divell, when his malice is ſtrongeſt to do us hurt. And though we may be dangerouſly foyled in theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall combates; yet Chriſt will uphold our faith, he will give us ſpirituall conſolation, and will ſpeak peace to our ſouls and conſciences, when through weakneſſe of body we cannot expreſſe the joy and comfort of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, before we can willingly leave this world, we muſt be well perſwaded that we ſhall injoy a better ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in the world to come, which holy perſwaſion that we may have, we muſt ſeriouſly conſider how we have done the works which God hath appointed us, how we have improved the talent that he hath lent us, how we have glorified God in our calling, and what good we have done to our neighbour, according to the means, and ability that God hath given us: for we muſt give an account of all theſe things before the Tribunall Seat of God, and we ſhall be judged according to our works.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we can truly ſay that we have done Gods works to the beſt of our power, &amp; with an upright heart, and that we have well improved our time, and our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the glory of God, then we may ſay with Chriſt, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and with <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 7. 8</note> 
                  <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe and have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118343:129"/> me at that day: and not to me onely, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> And though our work hath been very imperfectly done by us; yet Chriſt our Saviour will make it perfect by that which he hath done for us in our nature, and God will accept it for his ſake: then we ſhall cheerfully reſign up our ſouls to God at the hour of our diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſt doth here teach us to commend our ſouls into the hands of God; we received them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from God, and therefore we ought to reſign them up again unto him, he breathed into us the breath of life, which is our chiefeſt and moſt precious Jewell, and therefore we ought to keep it holy and undefiled for him, that when he is pleaſed to call for it, we may be ſure to deliver it up to himſelf: for the Divell will be ready watching for it, as ſoon as it is ſeparated from the body, and none can keep it from him but onely God. Wherefore we muſt keep our ſouls ſo pure and clean, that God may accept them, and take them into his charge: for if we preſent unto him a filthy ſoul, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the guilt of ſin, we have no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God will take care of it, and keep it unto the general reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we ſhould ſtudy and labour to keep our ſouls clean from ſin, by waſhing them dayly in the blood of Chriſt by faith: if they be ſtained with the ſins of the day, we ſhould thus cleanſe them at night before we ſleep, and if they are defiled with the pollutions of the night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we muſt not forget to waſh them with the teares, ſighes and groanes, that flow from a ſorrowfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart in the morning, before we ſet about our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſions in our calling, that we may comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believe that God will bleſſe and proſper our handy work.</p>
               <p>If this be our dayly and conſtant practiſe, the bleſſing of God will go along with us in all our actions, ſin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then cleave to our ſouls to make death fearfull to us,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:118343:129"/> death cannot then come ſuddenly upon us, neither will the remembrance of it be terrible; but we ſhall cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend our ſouls to God; becauſe we may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe that he will keep them in his heavenly manſions, untill they ſhall be again united to our bodies with an unſeparable union, and made glorious bodies fit to live and reign with Chriſt for ever.</p>
               <p>But naturall men know not the worth of their ſouls, nor the great price wherewith they are redeemed, if they belong unto Chriſt, they ſuppoſe that the ſoul cometh from a Principle of nature, as the body doth; whereas it is an immortall ſpirit, which proceedeth not from any mortall principle, but is breathed into us by the holy Ghoſt, as ſoon as the body is framed in the wombe, and made capable to receive this breath of life. Though the ſoul be thus highly to be prized, and far excelleth the body in worth and dignity; yet naturall men will pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and garniſh out the body, which is every day ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption and change; but they ſuffer their ſouls to ſtarve for want of ſpirituall food, and to go naked for want of ſpirituall cloathing; whereby they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the venomous darts of the Divell, and to the ſcorching heat of their ſinfull luſts. Their ſouls have no ſpirituall light to foreſee dangers and to ſhun them, they have no heavenly grace to reſiſt the temptations and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of the world, the fleſh and the Divell; but what the eye or the eare lets in, is willingly received. Thus their ſouls are polluted and unclean, and death doth ſnatch them away; becauſe they cannot willingly deliver them up: for they have no faith to believe, and no aſſurance to perſwade them, that God will receive their ſouls, when they are parted from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>This is the condition of our ſouls by nature, and ſo long as they are in this condition God will not receive them, and then they muſt needs be a prey to the Divell. <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 103<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> But Chriſt hath redeemed our ſouls from deſtruction,

                  <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> he hath bought us with a great price, he hath ſhed his moſt precious blood upon the croſſe, to take away the guilt and filth of our ſins.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, God may juſtly claim our whole man, both ſoul and body as his due by a treble right; by the right of creation, of donation, and of purchaſe: <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 17. 28</note> for <hi>in him we live and move and have our being;</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7</note> 
                  <hi>What have we that we did not receive from God?</hi> What ſhall we bequeath unto him in thankfulneſſe for all his benefits to us? We can do no leſſe than devote our ſelves, ſouls and bodies to him, and to his ſervice while we live here; and when this life ſhall be ended, to bequeath our precious ſouls unto him, purified and cleanſed from all ſin in the blood of Chriſt by faith, for nothing can be too pure that is preſented to him, and nothing can be too dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for him</p>
               <p>If we bequeath this precious legacy to God in our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, then he will require it, as of right belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and he will receive it from us at our death: This will ſweeten the bitterneſſe of death to us, which will put an end to all our ſorrowes, and this will make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave this world, and deſire with <hi>Paul</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; becauſe we do ſtedfaſtly believe that we ſhall be with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if we give our ſelves to worldly vanities, to lewd and licencious living, and not to the true worſhip and ſervice of God; we ſhall then be unwilling to part with this life, or to look upon death when it comes, becauſe we know not to whom it will deliver our poor ſouls: for we cannot comfortably commend them to God when we dye, with any hope or good aſſurance that he will receive them; ſeing they did God no ſervice while we lived. What thankfulneſſe is it then to commend our ſouls unto God, when we can keep them no longer for the world, or for our ſinfull delights? And what comfort can we have at our death, if we have no faith to believe that we ſhall injoy all happineſſe with Chriſt,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:118343:130"/> but rather juſt cauſe to fear that the ſinfulneſſe of our life will bring us to everlaſting torments after death.</p>
               <p>It may ſometimes fall out that we ſhall neither have time nor ability to diſpoſe of our ſouls when we dye, as we deſire and as we ought: for if death comes ſuddenly upon us by any caſualty or otherwiſe; we have then no time to commit our ſouls unto Gods protection: or if we are taken away by ſome violent or malignant diſeaſe, which doth diſtemper our ſenſes, and weaken our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon, that we are unfit for this great work, we have then no ability to reſign up our ſpirits unto God in an holy way.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we do then? Where is our comfort in death? This need not trouble our thoughts, if we have formerly in our life had any holy aſſurance of our union with Chriſt, of our juſtification by his righteouſneſſe, of our redemption by the merit of his blood, and of his death, and of his ſanctification by the holy Ghoſt; and that we have lived vertuouſly and piouſly in the fear of God, and have ſerved the Lord our God with a perfect and upright heart in the time of our life: for then death cannot come ſuddenly upon us, and no extremity of ſickneſſe or pain can ſeparate us from Chriſt, nor take away our comfort from our ſouls at our death; becauſe God will receive them up into his holy habitation, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and dwell with Chriſt for ever, though we have neither time nor ability to commend them unto him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let us zealouſly meditate for our great comfort upon the bloud and water that guſhed out from our Saviours heart after he was dead, when his ſide was pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the ſpear. There was bloud to take away the guilt of ſin for our juſtification, and there was water to waſh away the ſtains of ſin for our ſanctification. For as our ſins were imputed to him as our ſurety; ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by faith his righteouſneſſe is imputed to us, and God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and righteous in his ſight for the ſake of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118343:131"/> Chriſt: ſo likewiſe by grace we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> renewed dayly and ſanctified in our lives and converſations.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we ſhould raiſe up our thoughts, and the affections of our hearts to this ſanctifying water, when we think upon our Baptiſme, or ſee that Sacrament cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, that our hearts may be ſprinkled with it by faith, to purifie our ſouls from the leproſie and ſpots of our ſins. Alſo we muſt ſet the cogitations of our hearts upon this ſacred blood, when we feed at the Lords Table, that by faith we may be perſwaded that Chriſt did ſhed his blood and was crucified for us.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, that though the body of our bleſſed Redeemer was miſerably rent and torn by the cruelty of his enemies, yet God would not ſuffer them to break a bone of him, according to this of <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 20</note> 
                  <hi>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken:</hi> and though they brake the bones of the two malefactors that were crucified with him; yet they brake not a bone of him, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be fulfilled, <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 9. 12.</note> that <hi>not a bone of him ſhould be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſo reſtrained his bloody enemies, that they could do no more than what was decreed, and what Chriſt was willing to ſuffer: for he did not yield to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and cruelty, but onely in obedience to his Fathers will: for a word of his mouth had been ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all his tormentours; but how then ſhould our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption be wrought? How ſhould the will of God be fulfilled? And how ſhould he have learned by his own experience what we ſuffer when we are under the croſſe, that he might pity us?</p>
               <p>This may teach us to bear patiently whatſoever God doth lay upon us, though the inſtruments that he uſeth be our deadly foes; becauſe it is his will and pleaſure to have it ſo. <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Meditation will greatly comfort our fainting
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:118343:131"/> ſpirits, when we are under any ſtrong temptation, or worldly miſery, that no enemy, be he never ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or his heart never ſo malicious, can imagine more againſt us in his wicked thoughts, or act more with his cruell hands, than Divine Providence hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Alſo, no calamity, pain or ſickneſſe can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us without his will, no perill or danger can come near us without his permiſſion, and we ſhall ſuffer no more under any croſſe, than God in his wiſdom know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to to be profitable for us.</p>
               <p>If we are thus perſwaded, it will greatly comfort us in all our ſufferings, and keep us from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and repining when GODS viſitation is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let no fear of danger caſt down our hope, let no ſtorme of perſecution ſhake the foundation of our faith, and let no waves of affliction quench the flame of our love, or abate the zeal of our affections to our dear Saviour, who ſpared not his own life for us, but poured out his very heart bloud for our juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the ſtrength of grace that is in us be not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to what we ſuffer, or to the power of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Chriſt will either take off ſome part of our burden, or give us more ſtrength to bear it; and he will alſo make us able by degrees to overcome our corruptions, that we may live a ſanctified life to the Lord; and then let death come how, or when it will, we ſhall dye in the Lord, which will be great gain and advantage to us.</p>
               <p>Now let the Meditations of thy heart be fixed upon the death of thy precious Saviour, that from thence thou maiſt draw vertue and power by faith to mortifie and kill the body of ſin, that by nature, is in thee, &amp; alſo to have a firm aſſurance that he hath reconciled thee to God by the merit of his blood. Why then doſt thou cheriſh any ſin to crucifie thy Redeemer afreſh? What is this that thou doeſt when thou delighteſt in ſwearing, in uncleanneſſe, in drunkenneſſe, and the like? Why doſt thou delay
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:118343:132"/> thy turning unto God? Why doſt thou thus indanger the ſalvation of thy ſoul? Oh think upon the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy ſin with hatred and deteſtation, which hath put to death thy gracious Redeemer, think upon thy ſin with godly ſorrow and true compunction of heart, which did ſo ſeparate thee from thy God, that nothing could reſtore thee into his grace and favour, but the death of his eternall Son.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeek earneſtly by faithfull Prayer to thy ſweet Saviour, that thou mayeſt finde the vertue, and power of his death in the crucifying of all the ſeverall members of this body of ſin, that by nature is inherent in thee, that ſo thy corruptions may be weakened, and thou mayeſt be dayly renewed by the ſtrength of that ſanctifying grace, which the Holy Ghoſt hath wrought in thee.</p>
               <p>Conſider now in the laſt place, how rigorouſly God did deal with his onely Son throughout his whole paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he gave him no intermiſſion in his ſuffering; but as ſoon as one ſorrow was paſt, another preſently came in the place, when one pain was over, a greater was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſupply the room: <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 102. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>his heart was ſmitten and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered like graſſe, ſo that he forgat to eat his bread:</hi> his torturings came ſo faſt upon him, that he had no time to refreſh himſelf with bread or water; but above all Gods fury was upon him in all his ſufferings, which made his paſſion beyond the ſtrength of nature. God never dealt thus with any of his ſervants; but ſtill they had ſome intermiſſion in their afflictions, ſome comfort in their ſorrowes, and ſome heavenly conſolation to uphold their ſpirits, or elſe a joyfull deliverance out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> had his afflictions, and yet at length God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to great honour. <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as faſt as one meſſenger could follow another, at laſt miſery ſeized upon his own body: but in the end God gave him double as much as he took from him. So
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118343:132"/> likewiſe <hi>David</hi> and many more have ſuffered very great afflictions and torments, but none like unto Chriſt, whoſe paſſion continued to his heath. <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note>

Wherefore, howſoever God is pleaſed to deal with us in this life, it will be in mercy and in judgement for our good, and not in fury, or in the rigour of his juſtice for our confuſion, and he will boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully reward us in the life to come, if we hold out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the end.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, by theſe miraculous ſignes and wonders God did convince his people of the hardneſſe of their hearts, and of their wilfull blindneſſe, who would not ſee the fulfilling of their ancient Propheſies in Chriſt, nor believe that he was that Meſſiah which was promiſed, though they could object nothing againſt it.

                  <hi>Truly this was the Son of God.</hi> Thus will God honour thoſe that honour him by a vertuous and godly life, or by their ſufferings in his cauſe: for he will make their innocency to appear, and will manifeſt the truth of their Profeſſion to the honour of his own Name, and he will give them immortall glory in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou art in place of authority, honour God by executing judgement and juſtice without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:118343:134"/> of perſons; if thou art rich, honour him in the right uſe of them, and with works of mercy to the poor and needy; if thou art poor be content with thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If thou haſt children, honour God in their good education, teach them the fear of the Lord, and let thy verteous life and good converſation be an example of piety to them. Alſo if thou haſt a family, command thy children and ſervants to keep the way of the Lord, to walk in his Statutes, and to do righteouſly, that the Lord may bring a bleſſing upon thee, and upon thy houſe.</p>
               <p>If thou art under the croſſe, honour God with thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, hope, and confidence in him whatſoever thy condition be, honour him with thy thankfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God doth give us to underſtand by the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the earth, and by the renting of the rocks, how powerfully the holy Ghoſt doth ſometimes work upon our hearts at our firſt converſion, to bring us to repentance, <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 9.</note> as he did at the converſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 16.</note> and at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jailor, and of diverſe others, for though our hearts be naturally as ſtupid and dull to any thing that is ſpirituall and heavenly as a lump of earth; yet when the holy Ghoſt works upon them with his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, he will make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them quake and tremble, and he will put a new Principle of grace into them, whereby they ſhall be changed into a gracious condition, and their natural dull and ſtupid properties ſhall be made active and ready for every holy duty. And though our hearts are by nature as hard as any ſtone, and no way capable of any gracious and heavenly impreſſion; yet the Spitit of God will break them in pieces, and will mollifie and ſoften every piece, to make it tender and flexible to the will and pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou doſt find this dulneſſe in thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, this earthly mindedneſſe, and this ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thine affections, that thou haſt no will to ſerve thy God; alſo, if there be ſuch obduracy in thy heart
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:118343:134"/> that thou canſt not lament, and mourn for thy ſins, and thy heart cannot melt into ſighing and tears for thy tranſgreſſions, and if there be ſuch unbelief in thee, that thou canſt not apply any promiſe of mercy to thy ſelf, and canſt have no hope nor aſſurance of the pardon and forgiveneſſe of thy ſins upon thy repentance and turning unto God; then make thy condition known to thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt in all meekneſſe of ſpirit, and he will put an holy light into thy underſtanding by his Spirit, he will ſanctifie thine affections, and ſeaſon them with grace, he will take away thy hard heart of unbelief, and will make it more ſenſible of thy miſerable condition, and will fit and prepare it for a deeper impreſſion of grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God doth ſhew by the opening of the graves that there ſhall be a generall reſurrection of every mans body at the laſt day, when they muſt appear before the judgement ſeat of God, to give an account of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have done in the fleſh. Though our bodies are lockt up in the grave for thouſands of years, and though their duſt and aſhes are ſcattered abroad with the winde to the utmoſt parts of the earth, yet at the laſt every grave ſhall be opened, and ſhall deliver up her dead, and every grain of duſt ſhall be gathered together, that every man may have his own body, to deliver up his account before the great and dreadfull Judge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, to receive the juſt reward of their works: the wicked to be thruſt down with the devils into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings for their evill deeds, and for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; but ſuch as belong unto Chriſt ſhall be received up to eternall glory: The Saints that then aroſe out of their graves were forerunners of this generall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>This was a dreadfull ſign to the cruell <hi>Jews</hi> who had imbrewed their hands in the blood of Chriſt: for the ſame Jeſus, whom they crucified, ſhall be the Supream Judge at that day, before whom they muſt appear, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for this their bloody fact.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:118343:135"/> It may alſo be a terrible warning to all wicked men, that are defiled with innocent blood, and that live in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe and ſenſuality, fulfilling their ſinfull luſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remorſe of conſcience, or holy deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from their wicked wayes, and without any care to make their peace with God by faith in Chriſt, and by true repentance: for a time will come when they muſt anſwer the rigour of Gods juſtice for all their crying ſins, and hainous abominations.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, enter into a ſerious conſideration with thy ſelf, how thou art prepared and fitted for thy grave. If thou haſt lived to the world, to the fleſh, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or to thy ſelf, thou art in a ſad and lamentable condition: for the grave cannot keep thee from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but muſt open her mouth, <note n="h" place="margin">Jona. 2 10</note> like <hi>Jonahs</hi> Whale, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, and it will deliver thee up even as it ſound thee. If thy grave receive thee an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a blaſphemer, a ſwearer, an unclean perſon, or the like; it will deliver thee up to judgement all pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the guilt and filth of the ſame ſins. <note n="i" place="margin">Job 20. 11</note> 
                  <hi>If thy bones are full of the ſins of thy youth, they will lye down with thee in the duſt,</hi> and they will cleave faſt to thee, when thou ſhalt riſe again. How canſt thou then ſtand before the Tribunall ſeat of God, and before all his glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and bleſſed Saints, if thou art in this ſinfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And how canſt thou endure the rigour of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the ſeverity of his judgement?</p>
               <p>If this conſideration were well imprinted in thy heart, it would make thee afraid to go on in a way of ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as have lived to the Lord ſhall dye in the Lord, and ſhall ſleep quietly in their graves as in their beds, <note n="k" place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> for they are the Lords Jewels, and he keeps them in theſe cabinets, untill the day that he ſhall make up his Jewels.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if we have any intereſt in Chriſt by faith, his blood will cleanſe us from all our ſins, his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118343:135"/> will make us accepted in the ſight of God, and he will account us as his jewels, and then Chriſt will ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the grave to us. <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 57. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and his naturall body was raiſed up a ſpirituall and glorified body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what comfort can we draw from Chriſt now he is dead? Can we have any benefit by him as he is now bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried? It is true which Chriſt ſaid, <note n="e" place="margin">John 6. 63</note>

               <p>Now if we will bury our ſins in the Sepulchre of our bleſſed Saviour, we muſt not onely forbear the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all committing of ſin; but we muſt quite looſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful remembrance of it: for if we do ſtill retain with approbation a ſinfull remembrance of our former ſins, we do then keep them above ground and unburied, and they will be odious in the ſight of God, though the act of ſin be mortified in us. <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>If we are baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, we are baptized into his death, and therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſme into death, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin, but ſhould walk in newneſſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we be thus buried with Chriſt, then the ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume and precious odours of his merits will take away the ſtench and noiſomneſſe of our ſins from the Lord our God. Wherefore, by faith we ſhall draw a new principle of grace from Chriſt, to be crucified with him, to live and dye in him, to be buried with him, both in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:118343:136"/> the act and in the delight of ſin, <note n="g" place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> and to riſe again with him in an holy and ſanctified life, and we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with him, to have our communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him: for every member of his myſticall body will be where he is in a ſpirituall manner; becauſe Chriſt will draw him to himſelf by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thus is Chriſt alſo preſent with us by his grace, and holy Spirit, to aſſiſt and ſupport us, to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in what condition ſoever we be.</p>
               <p>There is the ſame relation by faith between Chriſt and us, as is between the head and the members; and we ſhall injoy the comfort of this bleſſed relation by our heavenly Meditations of him: for then by his Spirit he is preſent with us to teach us ſome heavenly inſtructions for our edification, which we ought carefully to practice that he may be honoured thereby.</p>
               <p>There is no time, or place but we may take occaſion to Meditate ſomething on Chriſt for the good and comfort of our ſouls; either as he is our Mediator and Redeemer, or as he is our Prophet to teach and inſtruct us, our high Prieſt to preſent our Prayers and oblations to God, or our King to rule and govern us by his Spirit. If we Meditate upon his paſſion, upon his death and buriall, he will ſhew us how low he did humble himſelf to advance us, and it will much comfort us in our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſorrowes, and alſo it will fit and prepare us for death and for the grave, that we may as willingly lye down in the grave, where we ſhall reſt in peace, as we take our reſt and ſleep in our beds. By theſe and the like Meditations of Chriſt, we ſhall injoy his ſacred ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by his Spirit, and he will make us feel true conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereby. But if we Meditate upon the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, we muſt raiſe our affections up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens: for there he ſitteth at the right hand of God above all principalities and powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then he will ſhew us how victoriouſly he triumpheth over all his enemies, and that he hath ſubdued all the enemies of our
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118343:137"/> ſalvation, to teach us to fear and reverence his ſacred Majeſty, to perform all dutifull obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to ſubmit to his rule and government. And becauſe he is our Advocate with the Father, we may come boldly to him in all our wants, troubles and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.</p>
               <p>Alſo, faithfull Prayer is another ſpeciall means to injoy the comfort of this happy relation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we have with our Saviour Chriſt in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life, and upon all occaſions whatſoever, to give us comfort in all our diſtreſſes, ſtrength of grace againſt temptations, protection in all dangers, and deliverance out of all troubles.</p>
               <p>If our Prayers proceed from a faithfull heart, they cannot return without a bleſſing: for they will open Chriſts rich treaſury, and whatſoever is there, we ſhall have ſo much of it as is good for us. This kind of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will yet reach higher: for it will ſo prevail with Chriſt, that he will open his heart to us, and conceal nothing from us that may conduce to an holy and ſanctified life here, and to the injoyment of eternall bleſſedneſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>If we dayly converſe thus with Chriſt in our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers, we ſhall have our converſation with him in heaven, though we live in a vale of miſery here upon earth.</p>
               <p>Now then examine thy ſelf what communion thou haſt had with thy dear Saviour; hath he walked with thee in the field, as he did with <hi>Iſaack</hi> in his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hath he travelled with thee in the way, as he did with the two Diſciples as they went to <hi>Emmaus?</hi> Went he into a ſtrange land as he did with <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt?</hi> or was he in priſon with thee, as he was with him and with the Apoſtles? Haſt thou had his company in thy bed-chamber, or in thy cloſet as <hi>David</hi> had? Was he in the dungeon with thee as he was w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Jeremiah?</hi> Haſt thou had his company when thou haſt been among ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118343:137"/> as <hi>Daniel</hi> had among the Lyons, and as <hi>Paul</hi> had when he was in the Lyons mouth? And hath he been with thee upon thy ſick-bed, as he was with <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> Then ſurely thou haſt received ſome bleſſing from him, then thou haſt learned holy inſtructions of him; how to bear thy croſſe without murmuring, and how to endure thy ſufferings with meekneſſe of ſpirit. Then alſo thou haſt learned how to pray zealouſly, how to live piouſly, how to fix thy truſt and confidence on him, and how to ſet thine affections upon him, by the plentifull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which thou haſt had of his goodneſſe to thee; that ſo thou maiſt dye in his love and favour.</p>
               <p>Examine thy ſelf alſo what ſin thou haſt killed, and buried: for if thou doſt leave thy ſins, becauſe thou haſt not ability to continue ſtill in them,, thy ſins do leave thee, but thou doſt not leave them, and they are not buried with Chriſt in his Sepulchre: for thou retaineſt ſtill the remembrance of them with delight and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and if thou hadſt ability and opportunity, thou wouldſt be as vicious ſtill as ever thou wert before. For unleſſe faith had ſealed thy union with Chriſt, thou canſt have no power from his death to mortifie thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to bury thy ſins with him; neither canſt thou live unto righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Conſider in the laſt place what ſubtile policy was uſed to make the Sepulchre ſure, that the body of Chriſt might not be ſtoln away, and to prevent his reſurrection from the dead: for, <hi>they ſealed the Stone, and ſet a watch about the Sepulchre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God did hereby make the truth of his reſurrection the more evident, to the great comfort of his children, and ſervants; but to the perpetuall ſhame and confuſion of his enemies, and of ſuch as will not believe it. For Gods Decree muſt ſtand, and nothing can prevail to fruſtrate his determinate Councell: Whatſoever wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men do vainly imagine, or contrive, God will bring to paſſe what he hath decreed for his own glory. This
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118343:138"/> is great comfort to the ſervants of God, that are under tyrannicall preſſures, and can ſee no means how to be delivered out of their ſlavery: for God will bring about his own purpoſes, and will be honoured in their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the ſhame and rebuke of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, that thoſe malicious Jews could not but be convinced in their conſciences, that Chriſt was the Son of God, by thoſe ſtrange wonders which they ſaw at his death; and yet they ſtill ſpit out their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, againſt him, though he were dead, and in the preſence of <hi>Pilate</hi> they term him a deceiver.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with wicked men when they are given up to a reprobate minde: for there is no end of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt God, and no end of their malicious and miſchievous practiſes againſt his ſervants, and againſt all that profeſſe his Name.</p>

               <p>CHRIST was in the boſome of the Father from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where he was cloathed with fulneſſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Glory in the higheſt heavens, and had the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power over all things both in heaven and in earth: but when he was to undertake the Work of our Redemption, which was determined by all the three Perſons in the holy Trinity, before the world was, he laid aſide his Glory, and humbled himſelf for that great Work, which was decreed in the ſecret Counſel of God, and to be wrought at his appointed time. The firſt degree of Chriſts Humiliation was, that he gave away the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of glory of his Deity, which he had with the Father in heaven, which was his due from his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:118343:138"/> the bright beams whereof were clouded with his humanity: for he took upon himſelf our fleſh, and was cloathed with our weak and frail nature, and was ſubject to ſuch humane paſſions and infirmities as might be without ſin.

               <p>The ſecond Degree of his Humiliation was, that he took upon himſelf the guilt of our ſins, and did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to fulfill the whole righteouſneſſe of the Law for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for all the ſins of his Elect: not that his humane nature was polluted or ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any ſin: For the holy Ghoſt did ſo ſanctifie the Virgins wombe, that he was conceived and born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Originall ſin, and he lived without any actuall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; but our ſins were imputed to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13</note>

               <p>The third degreee of Chriſts Humiliation was, that he was content with a mean condition of life here upon earth; his birth and education was very mean, he was expoſed to wants and neceſſities, to perils and dangers even from his infancy; and after he began his Miniſtry he had no abiding place, <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>he had not where to lay his head,</hi> and he did the office of a ſervant to his own Diſciple, <note n="g" place="margin">John 13. 5</note> when he waſhed their feet: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="h" place="margin">Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus was his whole life full of ſorrowes and full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and thus low did the eternall Son of God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abaſe himſelf, to advance us and to perfect the work of our redemption.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in his paſſion he was made a ſcorn to the moſt abject of all the people, and a deriſion both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> he ſuffered both in his ſoul and in his body, as much anguiſh pain and torment, as the power of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and the malice of wicked men was able to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And as if all this was not ſufficient to humble him enough, God himſelf did fiercely aſſault him: for he kept all comfort from him, when he was in his greateſt extremity, and his wrath went along with all his other ſufferings.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt had ſuffered to the full, ſo much as the juſtice of God required in ſatisfaction for all our ſins, and that the work of our Redemption was perfectly finiſhed, then he commended his ſoul unto God, and dyed upon the Croſſe, according to this of the Apoſtle, <note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe:</hi> this kinde of death was moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſhamefull, and accurſed.</p>
               <p>Here is a ſhort view of the humiliation of Chriſt: for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118343:139"/> our weak underſtandings cannot reach to the depth of that which Chriſt ſuffered for us, much leſſe can we reach to the honour and dignity of his Perſon in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, which doth make his ſufferings, and his Humiliation far the greater. If we do ſeriouſly meditate upon it with pious affections, it will teach us to adore his ſacred Majeſty with reverence and godly fear, to love him with a perfect love, to ſerve and obey him with a pure and upright heart, and to ſuffer any thing for his ſake with a cheerfull minde. Alſo, if we have gained any grace by the death and paſſion of Chriſt, it will teach us meekneſſe of ſpirit, and humility of minde, though we have places of preheminence and authority above other men.</p>
               <p>If God ſhall bring us down from an high degree to a mean condition of life, we ſhall bear it contentedly; becauſe God is the ſole diſpoſer of all things, and he can raiſe us to an higher degree, if he pleaſeth. If what we have be too little for us, and that we can improve more to the beſt advantage of Gods glory, he will then in his good time beſtow more upon us.</p>
               <p>If our life be full of troubles and ſorrowes, the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Chriſt will teach us, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>to humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt us in due time.</hi> We may ſafely caſt our care upon him, for he careth for us, <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 18. 35</note>

                     <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Luk. 24.</note> did firſt appear by the teſtimony of two Angels to the Woman that came the third day to his Sepulchre to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm his body: <note n="b" place="margin">John 20.</note> then he appeard to <hi>Mary</hi> and to his Diſciples at ſeveral times: alſo to five hundred brethren at once, and he converſed with his Diſciples fourty dayes upon earth, before he aſcended up into heaven.</p>
               <p>Many Saints that ſlept were raiſed out of their graves with him, who alſo appeared to many in the holy City, and probably aſcended up with him into heaven; ſo that we may ſafely build our faith upon the truth of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is an Article of faith that we muſt believe for the well grounding of our hope, that our bodies ſhal alſo riſe again from the dead with ſongs of rejoicing and triumph.</p>
               <p>Here is matter of exceeding great comfort to our ſouls for our hearts to Meditate upon, if we do ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour is riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we may be truly perſwaded hereby, that he hath fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for all our ſins, and that the guilt of ſin is taken away from our ſouls, and nailed to his Croſſe, ſo that if God looks upon our ſins there, he will alſo ſee the precious blood of his dear Son that was ſpilt for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may firmly believe, that Chriſt by his Reſurrection, hath gotten the victory and conqueſt over ſin, death, hell and the Devill: <note n="c" place="margin">John 10. 18</note> for <hi>as he had power to lay down his life, ſo he had power to take it up again.</hi> Chriſt hath likewiſe taken away the ſtrength of ſin, and hath pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out the ſting of death, in that he hath fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and fully ſatisfied the penalty of the Law: <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> for, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi> Wherefore we may now draw vertue and grace from Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to overpower all the corruptions of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> and though we are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> yet by the power of his Reſurrection he will quicken us, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:118343:141"/> raiſe us up out of the grave of ſin, and will give us a ſpirituall life to live the life of grace to him here, that we may live the life of glory with him hereafter for ever.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we fear death that hath no ſting to wound us? Why ſhould we not ſmile upon it, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt hath ſanctified it to us? Why ſhould we fear the Devill with a ſervile fear, ſeing Chriſt hath redeemed us out of his bondage? His malice may moleſt and trouble us, if we be not well armed with faith; but Chriſt hath weakened his power below our ſtrength. When our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieslye in the duſt, our ſouls will be out of the devils reach: for Chriſt will take them up to himſelf into the Paradiſe of God, where the devil cannot come, for he is caſt down into utter darkneſſe; he may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tempt or afflict us while we are in the fleſh; but Chriſt, whom we ſerve, will not ſuffer him to prevail againſt us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing Chriſt our head is riſen from the dead, we alſo that are his members muſt riſe again at the laſt day: for the Head will draw all the members of the body with it.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath redeemed our bodies from the grave, as well as our ſouls from death: if therefore we be not raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again out of the grave, our redemption is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wrought. Alſo, if there ſhall be no reſurrection of our bodies, and if death hath power to keep them ſtill in the grave, then our union with Chriſt is not firm, and our faith is not able to keep us cloſe unto him, and our hope is not ſtedfaſt; but death hath not this power, the graves will open and deliver up their dead, and our bodies ſhall riſe again to injoy that unconceivable happineſſe with our ſouls of the beatificall viſion of God, and to be for ever with Chriſt our Redeemer; becauſe Chriſt our Head is riſen.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, our chief comfort dependeth upon our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to glory, for in this life we finde nothing but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:118343:141"/> and travell, ſorrow and trouble, vexation, and anguiſh of ſpirit: our hope of future reſt and peace, of joy and comfort, happineſſe and glory, doth ſweeten all our afflictions here, and makes us bear them contentedly and chearfully, for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 58. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily, there is a reward for the righteous,</hi> and this reward is in heaven. Now if there be no reſurrection from the dead, our hope is vain, our comfort will deceive us, and our life is moſt miſerable of all men, according to this of <hi>Paul:</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> for we ſhall never injoy this reward which God hath promiſed; but our faith is grounded upon the ſure promiſes of God, which cannot deceive us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection of our bodies unto glory, which will yield us unſpeakable conſolation, when we ſeriouſly Meditate upon it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, raiſe up thy ſpirit thou fainting ſoul, for Chriſt hath redeemed thy body from the grave, and thy ſoul from death by his Reſurrection, he hath conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the enemies of thy ſalvation; ſin hath no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power over thee, death is advantage to thee, hell is lockt up from thee, and the Devill himſelf cannot go beyond his commiſſion for thy hurt. Though the world doth frown upon thee, <note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 16. 33</note> and thou findeſt tribulation here; yet be of good chear, and lift up thy head: for Chriſt hath overcome the world, and he will ſanctifie all thy tribulations to thee. Thou liveſt here ſubject to ſhame and reproach, to diſeaſes of body and ſorrow of ſpirit, and to all miſeries and calamities; but death will put an end to all thy labour and travell, the grave will refine thy body from all imperfections and diſeaſes, and thy reſurrection will bring thee to thy reward, which is laid up for thee in heaven.</p>
               <p>If the powers of darkneſſe ſet themſelves in array a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, if the terrours of death aſſault thee, fear not, but keep cloſe to the Reſurrection of thy Saviour by faith, he hath overcome them all, and will alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

               <p>If the croſſe muſt try thy ſtrength, he will not tire thee with a greater burden than thou art well able to bear. If pain or ſickneſſe brings thee near unto death, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hope of a joyful reſurrection will greatly refreſh and comfort thy ſoul: for though thy ſoul muſt be parted from thy body; yet neither thy ſoul nor thy body ſhall be parted fuom Chriſt; but thou ſhalt riſe again out of the duſt with a ſpirituall and immortal body to be joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt thy head for ever.</p>
               <p>Now think on theſe things with holy affections, and they will miniſter heavenly comfort to thy ſoul, when thou art in any perplexity of minde or body.</p>
               <p>Conſider now to whom Chriſt appeared after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, it was firſt to holy Women, who in their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devotion and love to him came to imbalm his body with ſpices and ſweet odours: then he appeared to his Diſciples at ſundry times, and alſo to many Brethren, that they all might be well confirmed in the truth of his Reſurrection, and of his Deity, to comfort them in their ſorrowes, to uphold them in their ſufferings, to ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith againſt all perſecutions and bloody try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: and to be able to ſtrengthen others in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection. Thus did the holy Apoſtles teſtfiie that they had ſeen the Lord Jeſus after he was riſen, to confirm their Doctrine of his Reſurrection. But Chriſt did not appear to any wicked or ungodly men: for they could neither believe it nor underſtand it, nor receive any comfort or benefit by it, becauſe they have no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye to diſcern his glorified body, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have no relation to him as their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth appear to us at this day by his Spirit
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:118343:142"/> when he doth manifeſt to us the truth of his Reſurrection by his Word, and doth give us grace to apply it to our ſelves, for the confirmation of our faith in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies at the laſt day. But chiefly Chriſt doth appear to us when by faith we draw vertue and power from his Reſurrection, to riſe from the death of ſin to the life of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we can raiſe up the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our hearts from earthly and worldly cares to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly contemplations, and when we can with the wings of faith mount up above the ſinfull delights and pleaſures of this life, and above all the calamities and tribulations that we ſhall meet with here upon earth, to have our converſation in heaven, and can draw comfort to our ſelves in all our ſorrowes and miſeries from the hope of our reſurrection.</p>
               <p>There will alſo be a day of reſurrection to the wicked, which will be moſt ſad, wofull and miſerable to them: for they ſhall not riſe with purified and glorified bodies; but with filthy, ugly, and unclean bodies, all beſmeared with the guilt of ſin which will make them odious to look upon, and they have no covering to hide their ſins, but onely the Divels liverey, which is a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience, that they may be known to whom they belong: For there is no place, and no inheritance in heaven for ſuch unclean monſters; but they ſhall be thruſt down into the loweſt hell, to partake with the devil and his angels in their everlaſting torments, which is the reward of all wicked men for their evill works.</p>

               <p>Wherefore now, let the thoughts of our hearts be raiſed up in our holy Meditations to contemplate the tranſcendent glory of Chriſt, now he is at the right hand of the Father, that we may firmly confide in him, and have a longing deſire to be with him, to injoy that place of true bleſſedneſſe, <note n="a" place="margin">John 14. 2</note> which he hath prepared for us in his Fathers houſe.

Do we think that Chriſt will intercede for us, if we ſin wittingly and willingly againſt God? Will he procure our pardon, if there be any accurſed thing hidden in our hearts?

If a Kings Son that is heir apparent but to an earthly Crown, ſhould live like a baſe peaſant, and delight in the company of ſuch as are of mean and low degree, we wil be ready to ſay, that he is unworthy of ſuch an Inheritance.

               </p>
               <p>We may yet conſider further, how God hath exalted Chriſt: <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>For he hath made him the head of his Church,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 1. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church.</hi> Alſo, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 118. 12.</note> Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>the head ſtone of the corner in this ſpirituall building,</hi> and he doth ſo firmly binde every ſtone of this building to himſelf, that they ſhall never depart from him. Thus God is pleaſed to reveal in ſome meaſure how highly he hath exalted our dear Saviour after his great ſufferings in his bitter paſſion; but as we are not able to conceive what he ſuffered; ſo our weak capacity cannot reach to that tranſcendent glory and Majeſty, which he now hath in the ſame nature, as he was our Redeemer, God and Man.</p>
               <p>If God hath ſo highly exalted our glorified Redeeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then we muſt ſtudy and Meditate with an holy zeal and pious devotion, how to exalt him in our hearts, how to prize him in our affections according to his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and dignities, how to have a reverent eſteem of his worth, how to honour and reverence him for his greatneſſe, and <note n="l" place="margin">Hoſ. 3. 5.</note> how to fear and love him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Alſo, we muſt have a diligent care to obey his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118343:145"/> rule and government, as he reigns and rules in our hearts by his Spirit, that we may withſtand and reſiſt the temptations of the devill, that the alluring vanities of the world may not inſnare us, and that no evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence may overpower us, to make us diſhonour our God, or diſobey the will of our dear Saviour.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt be truly advanced in our mindes and thoughts according to the glory and honour wherewith God hath crowned him, then our ſouls will feel a comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of grace from his glorious Exaltation, to give us an holy aſſurance that he hath led captive all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies, and hath ſo weakened their power, that they have no ability to hurt our ſouls: alſo, that in his due Time he will take revenge upon all the Enemies of his Church. And as he is crowned with the higheſt titles of honour; ſo likewiſe he will crown the meaneſt of his Saints with honour and dignity far above the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Potentate upon earth. This doth alſo give us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we may receive from the fulneſſe of Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace for the mortifying of our ſins, for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of our lives, and for our comfort in all tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will ſupport us in all our ſpirituall weakneſſes, he will cure all the wounds that ſin hath made in our ſouls, and he will keep us from deſpair; becauſe he doth binde us with the bonde of faith ſo cloſe to himſelf, that we ſhall not totally and finally fall away from him, and he will ſo protect and defend us, that no adverſary power ſhall be able to take us out of his hands.</p>
               <p>But if we conceive of theſe high honours and dignities of Chriſt according to our humane capacity, and not according to the reach of faith, as it is grounded upon the Word of God, we ſhall too much undervalue his highneſſe, and diſreſpect his ſacred Majeſtie: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confide in his power to defend us againſt all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual adverſaries, neither can we reſt and depend upon his goodneſſe to ſupply all our wants, to miniſter relief in all our neceſſities, to heal all our infirmities, and to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118343:145"/> be all in all unto us upon all occaſions: our frail nature will be full of doubtings and fears to weaken our faith and confidence in him: for according to our eſteem of him in our hearts, ſuch is our faith, ſuch is our hope and truſt in him; if we have no ſpiritual eye to diſcern theſe eſſential honours and excellencies of Chriſt, we cannot then reach them with that reverence, and fear, with that duty and obedience as we ought, and our beſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice will come far ſhort of that which his great and dreadful Name requireth.</p>
               <p>Now then examine thine own heart and ſee what good, evidence thou haſt that Chriſt is dear and precious unto thee, and that thou doſt honour him with thy heart and ſoul, what experience haſt thou had of his goodneſſe and power? How haſt thou performed thy duty and ſervice to him? What awful reverence and filial fear haſt thou had of his ſacred Majeſty, when thou haſt been in his preſence, and about his buſineſſe? If thy conſcience can tell thee, that Chriſt is the joy of thy heart, that he is thy Lord God, thy King and Governour; then he hath ſet up his Scepter of righteouſneſſe in thee, and ruleth in thy heart, and that hereafter he will bring thee to his eternall kingdom of glory.</p>
               <p>If the holy Ghoſt hath thus wrought in thy heart, thou wilt finde a conformity of will to the will of Chriſt, thine affections will be ſquared to the glory of God, to love that which he loveth, and to hate that which he hateth; thy ſinful deſires will be reſtrained: for the fear and dread of his great Name will be alwayes before thine eyes, and the love of him will conſtrain thee to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Alſo, the hardneſſe of the heart will be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26, 27.</note> and it will be made tender, and flexible, fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any heavenly impreſſion of grace.</p>

               <head>Our Advantage and gain by <hi>CHRIST</hi> in this life.</head>
               <p>EVery true believer hath a peculiar Advantage, and Gain by Chriſt, more than unregenerate men, in whatſoever they poſſeſſe: though theſe have more of earthly bleſſings and of common graces, than many of Gods ſervants; yet it is with a great deal of difference; for by Chriſt they are ſanctified to the one, &amp; not the other. But there is a ſpirituall Gain by Chriſt which is onely proper and peculiar to the children of God, whereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are not capable, until faith be wrought in them by the holy Ghoſt to unite them unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we have this Advantage by Chriſt above un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> that the curſe which God laid upon the creatures for the ſin of man is taken away, and he hath given to every true believer in Chriſt the free uſe of them all for his comfort, and to glorifie God in their right uſe, and by their thankfulneſſe for them: for Chriſt hath ſanctified them, and made them bleſſings to them. But unregenerate men have no right to what they injoy; becauſe they have no intereſt in Chriſt, and the curſe ſtill cleaveth to whatſoever they poſſeſſe: for Chriſt hath not taken it away, nor ſanctified their eſtate unto them for their good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is our peculiar Gain by Chriſt, that he hath taken away the guilt of ſin that by nature was upon our ſouls, and hath faſtned it to his own croſſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as naturall men have the guilt of their ſins ſtill cleaving to their ſouls, ſo long as they are in that condition. This is a great advantage to us that are in Chriſt, if we do well conſider it; for now we may appear with boldneſſe in the preſence of God, we need not fear the accuſations of the Divell, our conſcience can witneſſe nothing againſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:118343:146"/> us, becauſe we have no guilt of ſin, and the Law cannot condemn us. <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>There<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 6</note> 
                  <hi>For Chriſt was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>he was bruiſed for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Thus are our ſins imputed unto Chriſt; becauſe be hath taken them upon himſelf; and his righteouſneſſe is imputed unto us, that we might appear without ſin in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is a ſpeciall Gain that we have by Chriſt above all other men, that he hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> being <hi>made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</hi> Chriſt in our nature, and for us, hath fulfilled the whole righteouſneſſe of the Law, by his active obedience to it, and he hath ſuffered the penalty of it by his paſſive obedience, even to the death of the Croſſe, that the juſtice of God might be ſatisfied for all our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that now we are not under the curſe of the Law, nor under the condemning power of ſin, but we are under grace; becauſe he hath reconciled us to God, and brought us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his grace and favour, that the ſanctifying graces of his holy Spirit may ſeaſon our hearts and affections to walk before him in holineſſe and pureneſſe of living all our dayes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, our afflictions and troubles, which are part of this curſe, are ſanctified to us, and made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious and wholeſome for our good, and the evill of puniſhment, which we ſuffer, is taken away by the merit of his ſufferings, and the nature of them is changed into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements, to correct us for our ſins, that we may walk more obediently before God; or elſe they are to try the truth of our graces for the honour of God that gave them.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:118343:147"/>
               <p>Fourthly, this is another great Advantage and Gain that we have by Chriſt, which unregenerate men cannot finde, that he hath alſo freed us from the dominion of ſin: for though ſin will dwell with us ſo long as we live in the fleſh; yet the ſtrength and power of ſin is weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and killed by the vertue and power of that grace which Chriſt hath given us by his death.</p>
               <p>The beſt of Gods ſervants do often complain how the unregenerate part in them doth ſometimes prevail againſt the Spirit, which makes them groan under the burden of their corruptions, as holy David and others have done. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo found this to be true: for thus he ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 7. 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>I know that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I finde not: for the good that I would, I do not; but the evill which I would not, that I do.</hi> And he had no power but onely from Chriſt to be freed from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, and therefore he cryeth out, ſaying, <note n="f" place="margin">Rom 7. 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> for he found this Benefit and Gain by Chriſt, for ſaith he, <note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>To me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gain;</hi> or elſe we may read it thus. For Chriſt is to me both in life and in death advantage.</p>
               <p>This is not the gain which natural men look for, they ſeek after the gain of riches, the gain of honours, and the gain of worldly preferments; they look not after ſpiritual gain, they do not eſteem of vertue and godlineſs; piety towards God is out of requeſt with them, though it be the true gain and moſt to be deſired.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that we may get this ſpirituall gain of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; which is the advantage onely of a true Believer, Chriſt doth waſh us in the Laver of his righteouſneſſe, and therefore he beſtowes all ſanctifying and ſaving graces upon us, to purifie us from the ſilth and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſins. For Chriſt doth unite us unto himſelf by Faith, whereby we are cloathed with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:118343:147"/> and have all the benefits that come by the merite of his blood: then faith drawes in with it all other ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces, to make us compleat and perfect in Chriſt, to beautifie and adorn our ſouls, that we may lead a vertuous and pious life in the right way of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2</note> Chriſt doth alſo give us an holy deſire to <hi>the ſincere milk of the word, that thereby we may grow in</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> by whom we are brought into the favour of God; <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24</note> by whoſe grace &amp; love we are <hi>freely juſtified through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> by whoſe free grace alſo we are ſaved through faith in Chriſt. Saving grace was one of the ſpecial gifts that Chriſt gave after his Aſcenſion, according to this of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 13 9.</note> Wherefore, if our hearts are ſtabliſhed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> grace, we ſhal not be carried about with diverſe and ſtrange doctrines; but we ſhall ſtand firm in the Faith, and in the truth of our Profeſſion, and our hearts will be purged from dead works.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, we have this great Advantage by Chriſt above all other men, <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 4. 5, 6, 7.</note> that by him we receive the adoption of ſons, and thereby we injoy all the Priviledges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſons: for <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba Father;</hi> and we are made heirs of God through Chriſt. Wherefore, <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> in him we may <hi>come boldly unto the throne of grace</hi> by Prayer, <hi>that we may obtain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi> For God will have a fatherly care of us to protect us in all dangers, to provide whatſoever is good for us, and to comfort us in all our ſorrowes and diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 9. 9. Iſa. 25. 4.</note> Thus was God a refuge and a ſhield of defence to <hi>David,</hi> and to other holy men in their troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>If his rod of correction be upon us, it will be in love, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>as a father chaſteneth his ſon,</hi> that he may receive us as his ſons: and though we feel his viſitation ſharp; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lam. 3. 31</note> 
                  <hi>yet he will not caſt us off for ever,:</hi> for <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 4, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>we are ſealed unto the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118343:148"/> day of Redemption,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that we may through faith and patience inherit the promiſes,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>as heirs to an inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt hath ſealed the Covenant of grace to us with his own blood, whereby we are freed from the ſtrict keeping of the legal Covenant of Works; and Chriſt will perfect with his own righteouſneſſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wanting in us to the fulfilling of the Law, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the beſt we can with an upright heart to do the will of God; and then God in mercy will accept of our imperfect obedience for his ſake.</p>
               <p>This new Covenant, which Chriſt hath procured for us; will admit of the obedience of Chriſt for us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our true repentance for our ſins, which the legal Covenant would not; becauſe it required perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obedience to every tittle of the Law, both in thought in word, and in deed.</p>
               <p>By vertue of this new Covenant, <note n="x" place="margin">Jer. 31. 33, 34.</note> God is our God, and he will forgive all our iniquities, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our ſins no more: upon condition that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 12. 24.</note> who is the Mediator of this Covenant, and that with our faith we joyn piety and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath alſo given us his Sacraments, whereby this Covenant is ſealed to us, if we do worthily partake of them: but of this Covenant, and alſo of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I have written more fully in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p>Now Meditate with an holy devotion upon all theſe Advantages, which every true believer hath by Chriſt in this life above all other men, that have no intereſt in him by faith, and examine thy ſelf hereby what thou haſt gained by him. If thou haſt uſed the bleſſings of God and his good creatures ſoberly and temperately to his glory and not to pamper or cheriſh any ſin to diſhonour him thereby, and doeſt return thanks unto God for them
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:118343:148"/> with a ſincere heart; becauſe he is the ſole giver of all things that thou injoyeſt: then Chriſt hath taken away the curſe that was upon them, and hath made them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to thee, which thou maiſt freely uſe to thy comfort; otherwiſe thou canſt finde little comfort in them. Alſo, if thou doſt truly believe that thy ſins were imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and haſt an holy aſſurance hereof by the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renuing of thy repentance for thy dayly ſins; then thou maiſt be fully perſwaded, that the guilt of ſin, which was a burden to thy conſcience, and did cleave cloſe to thy ſoul, is taken away, and that Chriſt hath nailed it to his croſſe, whereby thou art freed from the curſe of the Law, and from the condemnation of ſin. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will much comfort thee, when thou art under the croſſe: for the evill of puniſhment that was in thine afflictions is taken away, it being part of the curſe, and thou art but chaſtiſed for thy good, and not puniſhed for thy hurt.</p>
               <p>Examine thy ſelf yet further what thou haſt gained by Chriſt: for if thou canſt over-power thy corruptions by the ſtrength of grace, and canſt leave thy ſins before they leave thee, and that the remembrance of them is bitter to thy ſoul, and doeſt dayly ſtrive with a true pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart to newneſſe of life; then thou haſt an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign, that Chriſt hath taken away the dominion of ſin in thee, <note n="z" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25.</note> and hath poured clean water upon thy ſoul, to purifie &amp; cleanſe thee from all thy filthines. Alſo, if thou doſt find the fruits of the Spirit of ſanctification, that thou haſt an holy deſire to the means of grace, and a faithful endeavour to grow ſtronger in grace, that thy heart may be ſtabliſhed in the truth, and thy Faith firm to uphold thee in thy ſufferings and tryalls; then thou haſt gotten great gain and much Advantage by Chriſt. But if thou art perſwaded of thine Adoption by Faith in him, thou canſt not conceive how great thy gain will be: for whatſoever a childe can deſire of a loving Father, thou mayeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much more from God: nothing ſhall be too dear

               <p>Let us conſider now, that our hearts may ruminate well upon it for our great comfort, what honour we have by being made the ſons of God. <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 23.</note> When <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants came to perſwade <hi>David</hi> to be the Kings ſon in law, he gave them this anſwer, <hi>Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a Kings ſon in law, ſeeing that I am a poor man and lightly eſteemed?</hi> How great then is the honour, and how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be eſteemed, for a poor wretched captive to be made the Son of the eternall and everliving God? to have ſuch a Father to come to in all our neceſſities, ſuch a Refuge in all our diſtreſſes, ſuch a Protectour againſt all our enemies, and to be heir to ſuch an Inheritance as is incorruptible and eternal, which Chriſt hath reſerved for us in heaven.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſhould be holy and undefiled in our converſations, as becometh the ſons of ſuch a Father, we ſhould not walk ſtubbornly before him, but in filial fear and reverence, obeying his holy will and commands with filial love, and ſubmitting to his rod and corrections, as a childe ought to ſubmit to his Father: If our ſervices are thus performed to God, he will then be a tender and a gracious Father to us.</p>
               <p>If we have this Gain by Chriſt in this life, what is the gain of the whole world to it? What is all earthly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the honour of a true Chriſtian? and yet moſt men covet and deſire that gain, and that honour, and they neglect the true Gain, and the true honour of a Chriſtian, which is chiefly to be deſired. <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 16. 26</note> 
                  <hi>What is a man profited,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if be ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we injoy Chriſt, we have a rich Patrimony, we can want no comfort, whatſoever ſhall betide us in ſoul, or in body, in goods, or good name; he will repair all our loſſes in <hi>Adam</hi> with his abundant righteouſneſſe, he will
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:118343:149"/> alſo repair all our loſſes in children, ſervants, or eſtate, either in this life, <note n="c" place="margin">Job. 42 10</note> as he did unto <hi>Job,</hi> or elſe in the life to come in a more plentifull manner. Chriſt will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe furniſh us with all ſpiritual abilities to encounter with the enemies of our ſalvation, to ſtand firmly for the truth, and for a good conſcience, and to endure the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our faith, love, hope and patience, and he will make perfect whatſoever is wanting, or imperfect in us: <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9</note> for his grace is ſufficient for us, and his ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe: his love and his care of us doth moſt ſhine forth, when we do moſt a baſe and humble our ſelves, and when we do acknowledge our unworthineſſe of it.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place we ſhould Meditate with all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon the great benefit that we have by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, which Chriſt hath ſealed for us with his blood: for we may faithfully believe, and comfortably expect, that God will perform his condition expreſſed therein to us, though we cannot perfectly perform our conditions to him; alſo, that he will purifie and cleanſe us from all our filthineſſe, <note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 32. 40.</note> and will put his fear in our hearts that we ſhall not depart from him, Wherefore, let not the failings and frailties of the fleſh diſcomfort us, nor weaken our faith and confidence in the goodneſſe of God to us in Chriſt: for the fleſh will rebell againſt the ſpirit, and the corruptions of the unregenerate part will ſometimes breake out upon us, to daſh and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our comfort in this gracious Covenant. Therefore Chriſt hath ordained the two Sacraments to ſeal this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to our ſouls, for the better confirmation of our Faith: <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3. 26, 27.</note> For if we are baptized into Chriſt by Faith, we have put on Chriſt, we are members of his Church, and this Covenant is ſealed to us; <note n="g" place="margin">1 John. 1. 7</note> and the blood of Chriſt hath cleanſed us from all ſin. If age, or ſickneſſe, or any thing elſe beſide ſanctifying grace, doth keep us from ſinning againſt God, this is not the true purging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſin, nor the regeneration and renewing of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118343:150"/> holy Ghoſt, becauſe the evill concupiſence of the fleſh, and the ſinful deſires of the minde will remain ſtrong, and will ſtill reign in us, though we cannot actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin. So likewiſe if we do ſpiritually feed upon the body and blood of Chriſt at the Lords Table, we do then ſeal this Covenant of grace to our ſouls, and we ſhall finde the comfort of all thoſe promiſes, that are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual food was the fruit that the Spouſe did feed upon, <note n="h" place="margin">Cant. 2. 3.</note> which was ſo <hi>ſweet to her taſte;</hi> and we ſhall alſo finde the ſame ſweetneſſe in that bleſſed fruit. But if we come to that holy Supper with mindes full of worldly cares, or ſinfull luſts, and with hearts full of hypocriſie and unbelief, we do eat and drink damnation to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>We need not now envy at the proſperity of ungodly men; their wealth is their ſnare to bring them into the paths of perdition, their gain is their loſſe, their pleaſure will be their pain, and their ſweetneſſe will be bitterneſs to them in the end: ſo that what gain ſoever they make of this world, if they do not alſo gain Chriſt with it, they will finde no Advantage nor true comfort by it.</p>
               <p>It is a ſhame for rich men, and a diſhonour for ſuch as are in eminent places of authority, if they are not truly vertuous and religious. This heavenly gain is peculiar onely to the Children of God, which they have onely by Chriſt, and they ſeek it no where but of him.</p>

               <p>If it be ſo, that none can eſcape the ſtroke of death, but that it will ſeize upon all fleſh with an unreſiſtible power, we ought then to be alwayes well prepared, that death may not come ſuddenly upon us, to take us away in our ſins, before we have made our peace with God by faith in Chriſt, and before we have got a modeſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aſſurance of the pardon of our ſins by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that we may willingly part with this world, and comfortably reſign up our ſouls to God in full hope, that we ſhall injoy a better life hereafters for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118343:151"/> and this preparation for Death is onely by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Conſider, now, that Chriſt will fit and prepare us for Death, and will alſo fit a Death for us, which ſhall make moſt for the glory of God, and be moſt advantagious to us; and he will ſo ſanctifie it to us, that our gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhall be far greater, than our loſs.</p>
               <p>If we dye in the Lord, or for the Lord, death may part our ſouls from our bodies; but it cannot part our ſouls from Chriſt: the ſoul may be parted for a time from a crazy, diſeaſed and corruptible body, which is but an earthly Tabernacle; but we ſhall receive the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies again, in full ſtrength, in perfect beauty, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, free from aches, or diſeaſes, from decay or corruption.</p>
               <p>Death may take our ſouls out of a world of miſeries and calamities, of ſorrowes, troubles and vexations; but it will preſently convey them into an haven of reſt, and into an heaven of happineſſe, where there is no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour nor toil, no troubles, nor ſorrow; but perfect peace and fulneſſe of joy for ever, and our bodies ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to injoy the ſame bleſſedneſſe with our ſouls. <note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> Death may diſſolve the <hi>earthly houſe of our tabernacle, but we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternall in the heavens.</hi>

               <p>Conſider in the next place for our further comfort, that we have this Advantage by Chriſt above other men, when we are to dye, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 55, 56.</note> that death hath nothing to hurt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118343:151"/> us, ſin hath no power to condemn us, and therefore death cannot binde us over unto judgement.</p>

                  <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> How can death then be any way hurtful to us? As Chriſt hath taken away the guilt of our ſins, ſo he will alſo faſten all our good works and pious duties to our ſouls, which will go with us to the grave, <note n="o" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13</note> and will follow us to the day of judgement, to be had in remembrance then before God. This is a bleſſed Advantage that we have by Chriſt in death above other men that have no intereſt in Chriſt. For their evil works cleave ſo cloſe to their ſouls, that they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them unto judgement, to increaſe their torments in their condemnation. Thus ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Some mens ſins are open before hand, going before to judgement, and ſome mens follow after. Zophar</hi> alſo ſaith thus of the wicked, <note n="q" place="margin">Job. 20. 11</note> 
                  <hi>His bones are full of the ſin of his youth, which ſhall lye down with him in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider alſo, that Chriſt through his own death hath deſtroyed the Divell, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14</note> that had the power of death; ſo that now the Divel is moſt weak againſt the ſervants of God at the time of their death: whereas to the wicked he is a ſtrong enemy, and will not be beaten from their beds-feet, until he hath gotten their ſouls, which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him for a prey <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luk. 10. 22</note> But God hath appointed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels to attend upon his children, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life, and to receive their ſouls from the hand of death, to carry them up into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</p>
               <p>This is a great comfort and benefit to them, when they are to leave this world, and it is ſuch a Gain, as no naturall and unregenerate man can expect.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, <note n="t" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10</note> we ought to uſe all care and diligence to make our calling and election ſure, and to make ſure our union with Chriſt by faith, that ſo we may live a ſanctified life to the Lord, and then let Death come how
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:118343:152"/> or when it will, we ſhall undoubtedly dye in the Lord, for death may come in an hour, or in a moment, when we look not for it; it may break in upon us like a theefe in the night, and take away our ſouls at unawares; but this need not trouble us: for if our life hath been holy and upright towards God, our death cannot be but ſanctified to us in Chriſt, who wil keep our ſouls out of the power of the divel. For if we have no other power to preſerve them from deſtruction, but what nature or common grace can afford us, we are not able to encounter with death, to make any advantage by it: for the ſtrength of nature will decay in us, and common grace can give us no antidote againſt the ſting of death: it is onely faith in Chriſt which is the true Antidote againſt the terrours of death, and againſt the power of the Divell: nature can give us no balm to heal the wounds, and putrid ſores that ſin hath made in our ſouls, which muſt be cured before we go hence, or elſe death will deliver them up in ſuch a loathſome condition, as that God will not accept them. <note n="u" place="margin">Jer. 46. 11</note> But if we go up to Mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> we ſhall finde balme there, which will cure us of all our ſpiritual diſeaſes.

               <p>Now let the Meditations of thy heart be continually how to injoy Chriſt in thy life, that thy ſoul may injoy him at thy death, and how to make the true gain of thy time here, that when death ſhall bereave thee of all time, Chriſt may be then thy gain for ever.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt have any hope of a comfortable death, thou muſt labour to live an holy life unto God: for a vicious and ſinfull life can give thee no aſſurance of a bleſſed death; and if Chriſt be not thy Redeemer in thy life, he will not be thy Saviour at thy death, to ſave
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:118343:152"/> thy ſoul from deſtruction, and to bring it to eternall bliſſe. Alſo, if thou deſireſt to injoy heavenly felicity with the Saints of God, thou muſt ſo live in the true fear of God, that thou mayeſt dye in his favour, and then death will open the door, and give thy ſoul free paſſage to injoy it.</p>
               <p>All the good that Chriſt hath procured for us by his death cannot be fully injoyed in this life; but is reſerved for us in heaven, which we muſt come to poſſeſſe by death; and therefore Chriſt will ſo prepare us for it with his ſanctifying grace, and will alſo prepare death for us, that it ſhall not hinder us of theſe great benefits; but be a ſpeciall means to bring us to the full poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>If we do well conſider and faithfully believe, that we ſhall have this gain by Chriſt in our death, how will it ſtrengthen us againſt the fears and terrours of death? How will it confirm us in a ſtedfaſt hope of a joyful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? How will it ſtir up our hearts and affections to live as becometh the children of God, that death may deliver up our ſouls unto him? and how willingly ſhall we part with this world, if we have an holy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to injoy a far better Inheritance in the world to come.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is no gain to unregenerate men in their death: for as they would not know him in their life, ſo he will not know them when they dye, but will leave them to the power of death, to binde them over unto judgement. Death will bereave them of all their wealth and poſſeſſions, it will ſtrip them of all their rich jewels, and precious ornaments, it will lay their honours in the duſt, it will take away all their beauty, ſtrength and comelineſſe, which was their pride, and it will leave them nothing but their winding-ſheet, neither will it give them any recompence for all their loſſes, but ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, pain and torment, which never ſhall have end. <note n="x" place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> Thus it was with the rich man in the Goſpel, for death
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118343:153"/> took him away from all that he had, and left him not ſo much as a little water to cool his tongue, when he was in the tormenting flames; and thus it is with all rich men, if they are not rich in faith and in grace.</p>
               <p>But ſome are not willing to dye through humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſſe, though they be in the ſtate of grace: <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> for the ſpirit may be ready, though the fleſh be weak. Others have no aſſurance of a better life, and therefore they would willingly keep this which they now injoy. Some again have their hearts and affections ſo glewed to earthly things, that the very thoughts of death is bitter to them. Others alſo are loath to dye becauſe they cannot provide for wife and children, and they have none to take care of them. Though God requires this Chriſtian care of them; yet we muſt not diſtruſt the goodneſſe of God, whoſe eye of providence is upon all his creatures; then much more upon thoſe that belong unto him.</p>
               <p>But when we have done our beſt endeavor in an honeſt calling to provide for them, &amp; yet muſt leave them ſcant of means for their ſubſiſtance; then God will have a ſpecial care of ſuch Widows &amp; fatherles children, &amp; therefore he hath given many ſtrict commands concerning them, and he hath made many promiſes of protection, help and comfort to them. <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 68. 5</note> 
                  <hi>A father of the fatherleſſe, and a judge of the widowes is God in his holy habitation.</hi> Alſo, God will bleſſe the children if their fathers have lived in the true fear of God, and he will provide for them if death takes away their parents, and they are left deſtitute of food and rayment: But this may be an advantage even to ſuch children; becauſe then they are immediatly commended to the care and providence of God, who beſt knoweth how to make proviſion for them, and he will neither be wanting in the truſt that is committed to him, neither wil he fruſtrate the hope of thoſe that reſt and depend upon him for ſuccour in time of need.</p>
               <p>Conſider in the laſt place what the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:118343:153"/>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 41. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That as the remembrance of death is bitter to a man that liveth at reſt in his poſſeſſions, unto the man that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vex him, and that hath proſperity in all things; yea, unto him that is yet able to receive meat: ſo the ſentence of death is acceptable unto the needy, and unto him whoſe ſtrength faileth, that is now in the laſt age, and is vexed with all things, and to him that deſpaireth, and hath loſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But none can be truly willing to dye, but onely a true Chriſtian, that is ingrafted into Chriſt, and hath an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſurance that he dyeth in the love and favour of God, and doth faithfully hope for that Crown of righteouſneſs, and that heavenly Inheritance which the righteous Judge hath reſerved for him.</p>
               <p>If we have this aſſurance by our union with Chriſt, and alſo a ſtedfaſt hope of ſalvation, well grounded upon the promiſes of God, we ſhall not be afraid to look death in the face, nor unwilling to reſign up our ſouls unto God, before death doth violently or ſuddenly take them from us. For Chriſt hath taken away the evill that is in death, and hath ſo weakened the power of it, that it cannot bereave our ſouls of that ſpiritual comfort and gain which we have by him, though ſometimes we cannot feel it in a ſudden or violent death, neither can it binde us over unto judgement: For nothing can diſſolve the union that is between Chriſt and our ſouls by faith. Though God ſhould take us away when we are young, or in our middle age, as he did that good King <hi>Joſiah;</hi> yet it ſhall be for our great Advantage, that we ſhould not ſee the evill that is to come, and the ſooner to injoy our eternall reſt and happineſſe with Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Alſo in heaven we ſhall be freed from all worldly temptations, from all carnal delights and earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that may intice us to ſin: <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 21. 27</note> 
                  <hi>For there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, nor whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie:</hi> for as the place is moſt pure, ſo they that come there muſt be pure and holy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in heaven we ſhall be freed from the iſſues of temptation, and that is ſin: for thus ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Nations ſhall be gathered unto the Throne

So long as we live in the fleſh we cannot but ſin againſt God; but when this mortal ſhall put on immortality, there will be then no more place for ſin, but our whole nature ſhall be made ſpiritural and heavenly. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould make us deſire with <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, we ſhall then be freed from all troubles and ſorrowes, from all pain and diſeaſes of body, from all anguiſh of ſpirit and grief of hears: <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 25. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For God will wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away.</hi> Thus are the ſervants of God freed from all temptations unto ſin, from all ſin, and from all miſery and ſorrow after death, by the merit of Chriſts death and paſſion; but carnal and unregenerate men carry their ſins with them to the grave, and death opens the gate to their eternal torments in hell: for it bindeth them over to the great and terrible day of judgement, when the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath ſhall be poured out upon them to their utter confuſion.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:118343:155"/>
               <p>We come now to conſider what great honour, and what joy and comfort the ſervants of God ſhall have by Chriſt after death: for though their life here be full of ſorrowes, yet after death they ſhall be freed from them all, and they ſhall alſo have the fulneſſe of all true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſhall injoy God himſelf, <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> who is the God of all comfort: for thus he ſaith by his Prophet, <note n="h" place="margin">Iſa. 51. 11, 12.</note>

               <p>Secondly, if we delight in pleaſures, heaven will afford us more than our hearts can deſire: <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8, 9.</note> There we <hi>ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of Gods houſe: and he will make us drink of the river of his pleaſures, for with him is the fountain of life, in his light ſhall we ſee light</hi> Alſo, the Pſalmiſt ſaith thus, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 16. 11</note>

               <p>Laſtly, that which makes up the fulneſſe of our joy and happineſſe in the Kingdom of heaven, is the eternity of it: for if we ſhould injoy it but for a time, it would greatly leſſen the comfort of our felicity; there ſhall be an end of time, but there will be no end of our bleſſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in heaven.

               <p>Conſider now, that whatſoever we ſuffer in this life is but for a ſhort time, and that the bitterneſſe of our ſorrowes is ſweetned with ſome comforts; alſo that our joy and felicity in heaven is for eternity, and that it is no way imbittered with any troubles or vexations; that we may patiently and meekly bear whatſoever God ſhall lay upon us, and earneſtly deſire to be uncloathed of this corruptible body, that we may put on the glorious robes of immortality for ever.</p>

               <p>So likewiſe, if we conſider and believe, that we have this Gain and advantage onely by Chriſt, it will make us ſtudy and labour by all meanes to injoy him, and when we have gotten ſome intereſt in him, to ſtick cloſe to him by Faith, to love him with intire affections, and to be obedient to his will and commands.</p>

               <p>If we want this heavenly light we muſt needs wander and go aſtray from God, and we have no means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a light, but by Chriſt. It is ſin that hath brought this darkneſſe and this ſpiritual death upon our ſouls, and none but Chriſt can take it away. This is the beginning of our ſpiritual life, when we have ſome light to diſcern the ſpirituall things of God, for the good of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is the food and nouriſhment of our ſouls, to preſerve this ſpirituall life in us, whoſe fleſh we muſt ſpiritually eat, and whoſe blood we muſt ſpiritually drink, by faith in the hearing of his Word preached, and Sacramentally, when we come to his holy Table; or elſe we have not this ſpirituall life in us. <note n="l" place="margin">John 6. 48, 53.</note> 
                  <hi>I am that bread of life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>which came down from heaven, who ſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day: for my fleſh is meat
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:118343:157"/> indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> Wherefore, if our ſouls do hunger and thirſt after this heavenly food, and do earneſtly deſire to be refreſhed and fully ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it is an evident ſign that there is a ſpiritual life in us: for Chriſt doth freely offer himſelf to every empty ſoul that can feed upon him by Faith in his Word, or in his Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But if our deſires and the affections of our hearts are taken up with the love of this world, and of earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; its no marvell if we have no hunger, nor thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and that we feel ſo little want, and need of him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the blood of Chriſt is the true balm to heal, and cure all the diſeaſes and wounds that ſin hath made in our ſouls: it is like <note n="m" place="margin">Lu 10. 34</note> the good <hi>Samaritans</hi> wine and oyl; for it hath a cleanſing and an healing vertue. There can be no wound ſo deep in the ſoul, and no ulcer ſo feſtered, but this precious Oyntment will cleanſe and heal it, if it be rightly applyed by faith and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for repentance layeth open the wound by true confeſſion, and faith applyeth the remedy to it, and then repentance giveth us an holy aſſurance that we ſhall be cured.</p>
               <p>This is the way, and the means of recovery, when our ſouls are ſick of any ſpirituall diſeaſe, and alſo to preſerve that ſpirituall life which is in us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when the heavenly graces that flow from Chriſt are poured out upon our ſoules, they will greatly refreſh and comfort our ſpirits in all ſadneſſe of heart, and they will ſo perſume all our actions and ſervices which we perform unto God, that their ſweet ſavour ſhall aſcend up unto him, that he may ſmell it, and graciouſly accept of us, and of our offerings. <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 8. 21.</note> When <hi>Noah</hi> offered burnt offerings to the Lord after the floud, the Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour, and accepted his ſacrifice, and bleſſed him exceedingly.

               <p>Wherefore take heed with what heart thou comeſt into the preſence of God, and that thou bringeſt no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him with a wicked mind; but firſt purifie thy heart from ſinne by faith in the bloud of Chriſt, and ſee that thy ſoul be perfumed with ſanctifying grace, and then come and offer thy gift, and God will accept it. But if there be any ſin in thy boſome unrepented of, or any iniquity in thy heart, which thou ſeekeſt to hide from God, then he cannot ſmell a ſweet ſavour of thy prayers, of thy praiſes and thankſgivings, or of any duty which thou performeſt to him, to make it accepted, becauſe thy heart is not upright before God.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt examine our ſelves what ſpiritual life we have by Chriſt, and we muſt know how he is our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, if we will have any comfort thereby.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <note n="q" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 20</note> If we have this holy unction from Chriſt, which was poured upon him above meaſure, that it might run down to every member of his myſtical body, which was typified by <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 133. 2.</note> that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecious ointment which was poured upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, and ran down to the skirts of his garments; ſo that we have a ſpiritual light, to diſcern the things that belong to our peace: then Chriſt hath wrought this life in us by his holy Spirit; for in the ſtate of nature we were dead to any thing that is heavenly; <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14</note> and we could not receive the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if our ſoules can feed upon heavenly food,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118343:158"/> and if we can expreſſe all other actions of a ſpiritual life, as to walk in the paths of holineſſe, to ſpeak the pure Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to have our converſation in heaven, while we live here upon earth; we may then be fully perſwaded; that there is a ſpirituall life in us: for ſo long as ſin reigneth in our mortall bodies, and untill there be a new creation wrought in us, we are ſpiritually dead to every good work, and we can expreſſe no actions of a ſanctified life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if our ſouls are cleanſed from the guilt of ſin in the blood of Chriſt, and if the filth and ſtains of our ſins are waſhed away in the Laver of Regeneration by his ſanctifying grace, and covered under his righteouſneſſe, that they appear not to the diſhonour of God, or to the hurt of our neighbour, and that we delight not in any ſin; but do ſtudy and endeavour to ſerve and pleaſe God with a ſincere heart and pure affections; it is a ſure evidence that Chriſt hath quickned, and raiſed us up from the death of ſin to the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if our duties and ſervices to God proceed from a clean, and a purified heart, which is ſanctified and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the graces and merits of Chriſt, then God will ſmell the perfume of them to accept of our perſons and of our holy offerings, becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt is in us.</p>
               <p>Thus we may know to our great comfort, if we narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look into our condition, what ſpirituall life we have, and that we have it onely from Chriſt, and by him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, now if thou deſireſt to live ſpiritually by Chriſt, thou muſt faithfully believe that he hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that ſpiritual death, which by nature was upon thee for thy ſins, and that he onely can give thee this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life: for as he hath vanquiſhed and overcome the power of death, both ſpiritual and temporal; ſo he can give a ſpiritual life, as well as a temporal, to whom and when he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual life thou muſt have from him, if thou
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:118343:159"/> canſt make a particular application of him to thy ſelf by faith, that he is thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer: for he hath then breathed into thee the Spirit of grace, which hath wrought this ſpiritual life in thee, though at the firſt thou canſt feel no power of it: without this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt to thy ſelf, thou canſt draw no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from him, and he will profit thee nothing. It did much comfort <hi>Job</hi> in his greateſt miſery, when he did thus apply Chriſt to himſelf. <note n="t" place="margin">Job 19. 25, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that my Redeemer liveth, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf.</hi> If thou canſt bring thy heart to cloſe thus with Chriſt, he will give light to thine eyes, food to thy ſoul, balm for thy diſeaſes, and comfortable refreſhing for thy languiſhing ſpirits. But if thou art ſtill dead in thy ſins, and haſt no ſpiritual life in Chriſt, thou canſt then feel no comfort by him: for what good can light do to a dead man? What bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit can he have by the daintieſt food? What can the beſt medicine profite him? And what ſenſe hath he of the beſt perfume? But if thou doeſt live in Chriſt, and he in thee, thou ſhalt partake with him in his fulneſſe of all ſpiritual graces: <note n="u" place="margin">Col. 1. 19</note> 
                  <hi>for it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fullneſſe dwell.</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">John 1. 16</note> 
                  <hi>And of his fulneſſe have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now conſider further, that Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of this ſpiritual life: <note n="x" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14</note> for he gave himſelf freely and voluntarily to be an oblation and a ſacrifice for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and from whatſoever we are lyable unto by reaſon of ſin, to wit, from the guilt of ſin, from the dominion of ſin, from the curſe of the Law, from the bondage of Satan, from the terrours of death, and from eternall condemnation. Alſo, by the power of his reſurrection he hath ſubdued and overcome death, hell, and the grave, that we might be raiſed out of the grave of ſin to live a ſpiritual life to God in Chriſt: Chriſt hath wrought our redemption by his active and paſſive obedience to the will of God, whereby we are juſtified in his ſight: for he hath taken our life out of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:118343:159"/> hand of Gods juſtice, where we had no hope to injoy it, and hath put it into the hand of his mercy, where we are ſure through Chriſt to have the comfort of it here, and the happineſſe of it hereafter.</p>
               <p>Though we muſt paſſe by the gates of hell before we can injoy the ſweet conſolation of this ſpiritual life, and though we muſt bring our ſelves ſo low in our humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in mortifying of our ſins and corruptions, as if we were ready to be thruſt down into hell; yet God will then give us a ſpiritual life in Chriſt to ſupport us, he will then raiſe us up to newneſſe of life by the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of his Spirit, that our ſpiritual life may appear, and that we may be made fit to injoy Chriſt for ever in the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt main end of the paſſion of Chriſt, that we may be redeemed by the merit of his blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of our ſpiritual life: for as we have our juſtification by the merit of his blood, ſo we have our ſanctification by the ſame blood, and theſe two cannot be ſeparated, but muſt go together; for we have no ſure evidence that we are juſtified in the ſight of God, but by the ſanctification of our lives. The Act of our juſtification is wrought at once, as ſoon as we are ingrafted into Chriſt by Faith; but our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be a continued Act, ſo long as we live in the fleſh: for the beſt of Gods ſervants have ſo many ſpots, and ſtains of ſin in them, that they have dayly need to pray to be every day purified and cleanſed with the blood of Chriſt, and to be dayly renewed with the graces of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond main end why Chriſt gave himſelf to be an oblation for us, that he might purifie us to be a peculiar people to himſelf, according to this of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This purification Chriſt worketh in us miniſterially by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:118343:160"/> the Preaching of his Word: for thus ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water, by the Word.</hi> Alſo, he doth waſh and cleanſe us Sacramentally from our ſins by Baptiſme: <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>For if we have been baptized into Chriſt, we have put on Chriſt, and then we are cloathed with his righteouſneſs, and with his holineſs, which are the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a ſpirituall life: for we muſt be holy as well as juſt;</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 14</note> 
                  <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> So likewiſe, <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 15. 9</note> 
                  <hi>faith doth inſtrumentally purifie our hearts as it hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Chriſt doth moſt effectually purifie our hearts from ſin and from uncleanneſſe by the holy Ghoſt, and by him doth convey this ſpiritual life of grace into us, without whoſe gracious concurrence no other means can be effectuall to us unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thus doth Chriſt bring us to a ſpirituall life, that our converſation may be holy and blameleſſe in the ſight of God. <note n="d" place="margin">Iſa 35. 8, 9</note> The Prophet ſpeaketh of <hi>a way of holineſſe, which is not for the lyon, or for any ravenous beaſt, but for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the Lord, they onely ſhall walk there.</hi> This is the priviledge onely of thoſe, <note n="e" place="margin">Heb 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe conſciences are purged in the blood of Chriſt from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> If Chriſt doth not thus waſh and purifie us, we have no part in him, <note n="f" place="margin">John 13. 8, 9.</note> as he ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> when he refuſed to let him waſh his feet. When we are thus cleanſed from our ſins, and have this ſpiritual life by grace in Chriſt wrought in us, then we are a peculiar people to him, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from ſinners, and from the vanities of this world; and wholely devoted to ſerve him; then we ſhall with <hi>Peter</hi> deſire more waſhing and cleanſing; <hi>Lord, not my feet onely, but my head and my hands:</hi> and then we ſhall have an holy zeal to do ſuch works as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and we ſhall do them by faith in Chriſt, and to the honour and glory of God, that the truth of our ſanctification may appear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the exemplary cauſe of our ſpiritual
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:118343:160"/> life: for he hath recorded his own life in the Goſpel, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 21</note> to be a perfect pattern of holineſſe to us, and an example thereby to learn how to follow his ſteps. If we deſire to live according to the rule of Chriſts life, we muſt be holy, and righteous in all our wayes, humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward all men, meek and patient in our ſufferings, ſober and temperate in all things, charitable to the poor, doing good to all, frequent and fervent in Prayer, and alwayes ſeeking the glory of God.</p>
               <p>This was Chriſts whole life, and thus ought we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our lives, that the fruits of a ſpirituall life may ſhine forth in the integrity of our converſation. Chriſt did ſhew the purity of his Miniſtery by the holineſſe of his life, and what he did Preach to others, he did practiſe himſelf. <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Learn of me, ſaith he, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though we cannot attain to perfection of holineſſe in this life; <note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> yet we muſt <hi>preſſe towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is the work of grace and not of nature to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in his ſteps, and the ſervants of God have their graces according to their meaſure: for ſome have more, ſome have leſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all have grace ſufficient to fit them for the kingdom of heaven, and according to their meaſure of grace, ſo is the purity of their lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. <hi>Abraham</hi> excelled all others in Faith, and therefore <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11</note> he is called the Father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Moſes</hi> excelled all men in meekneſſe: for the holy Ghoſt giveth this Teſtimony of him, <note n="l" place="margin">Num. 12. 3</note> 
                  <hi>that he was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth. Job</hi> was renowned for his patience. Thus ſaith <hi>James</hi> of him: <note n="m" place="margin">Jam. 5. 15</note> 
                  <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> Holy <hi>David, Daniel,</hi> and others excelled in Prayer and devout Meditations. Theſe and all other the ſervants of God had their ſeverall graces from Chriſt, and the ſtreams of his fulneſſe do ſtill plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully flow down to all that belong to the election of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:118343:161"/> grace, for the ſanctification of their lives.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is the finall cauſe of our ſpiritual life, which is, that God may be glorified thereby: to this end we were born, to this end ſhould tend all our words and actions, and Chriſt took upon him our nature, that God might be glorified by our ſalvation. Chriſt did alwayes ſeek the glory of God, both in his Miniſtery and in his miracles, both in his life, and at his death. Thus he ſaith of his Miniſtery, <note n="n" place="margin">John 12. 49, 50.</note> 
                  <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf; but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore I ſpeak, ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus alſo Chriſt glorified God by his Miracles; <note n="o" place="margin">Joh. 5. 19, 36.</note> for he aſcribeth the cure of the impotent man at the pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> to his heavenly Father, that he might have the glory of it, becauſe he ſent him to finiſh all thoſe works which he did.</p>
               <p>God is very jealous of his glory, <note n="p" place="margin">Iſa. 48. 11, 12.</note> he will not have <hi>his great Name to he polluted; and he will not give his glory to another. His hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and his right hand hath ſpanned the heavens: when he calleth unto them they ſtand up together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what end did God make the great Fabrick of the Heavens and the earth, but for his own glory? Why doth God execute his juſtice upon the wicked, but to get himſelf honour by their deſtruction? <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 14. 17.</note> as he did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt, when he drowned them in the red ſea. Why doth God beſtow his mercies and his bleſſings upon his ſervants, but to be honoured for and by them? And why doth Chriſt put into us a ſpiritual life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to honour and glorifie God thereby? <note n="r" place="margin">Lu. 5. 25.</note> If the man that Chriſt cured of the palſie glorified God for his cure, then much more ought we ſo to do, becauſe Chriſt hath cured us of all our ſpirituall diſeaſes. <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lu. 18.</note> If the man that received his ſight followed Jeſus, glorifying God, then ought we to follow Chriſt, and to glorifie God for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:118343:161"/> that ſpirituall light, which he hath put into our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and for that ſpiritual life which he hath put into our ſouls. <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 3. 8.</note> If the creeple, whom <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> cured, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and praiſed God; then we have much more cauſe to praiſe and glorifie God with joyfull hearts; becauſe Chriſt hath cured us of our ſpirituall lameneſſe, and of all other ſpiritual infirmities. Alſo, <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 27. 54.</note> if the Centurion, when he ſaw the earth-quake, and what was done at Chriſts death, glorified God, ſaying, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God:</hi> then ought we to glorifie God for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and for our Spirituall life, and to ſay, Truly this was the work of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>We may dayly ſee the wonderfull works of God, which he doth for his own glory, to give us dayly occaſions to honour and glorifie him; and therefore this ſhould be our continual practiſe, to magnifie the Name of God, according to this of <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Cor. 10. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether ye ear, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> It is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual work of the Saints and Angels in heaven to ſing <hi>Hoſanna to the higheſt,</hi> and it ſhould be our conſtant care here upon earth to glorifie God, and to magnifie him for all his benefits, mercies and goodneſſe to us.</p>
               <p>Thus we may come to have an holy aſſurance, that we have a ſpiritual life in Chriſt, if we do truly believe that he hath redeemed us by the merit of his blood from all our iniquities; and from all the iſſues of ſin; alſo, that he hath ſanctified us, and made us an holy people to himſelf, not to ſerve the world, the fleſh, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; but to ſerve the living God with a clean heart, and pure affections. So likewiſe, if we finde a new principle of grace planted in our hearts, whereby we are able in ſome meaſure to walk in the paths of godlineſſe, and ſo to ſteer all our actions, that they may tend to the honour and glory of God, the Peace of our conſciences, and the eternal comfort of our ſouls.</p>

               <head>How to injoy true Happineſſe.</head>
               <p>ALL men deſire to be happy; but few ſeek it where it is to be found: ſome ſeek it in morall vertues, and natural endowments, ſome in morall vertues, and natural endowments, ſome in worldly pleaſures, and profits; others think to finde it in riches and honours; but all come far ſhort of the glory of true happineſſe, though they do obtain their deſire in all earthly things: for all that this world doth afford, cannot make a man truly happy, ſo much as in this life, much leſſe can it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his happineſſe in the life to come: for there will ſtill be ſomething wanting, or elſe ſomething to imbitter their contentment in theſe things here below. If we have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or authority to day, we may be in ignominy and diſgrace to morrow; if we have riches and plenty to day, we may be expoſed to want and penury to morrow; ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or pain will blaſt all our earthly contentments; but when death comes, it will bereave us of them all. It is in vain therefore to ſeek our happineſſe in theſe vain things, or to put our confidence in them: for our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not conſiſt in uncertain riches, or in tranſitory honours and pleaſures, which in themſelves are nothing elſe but vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But true happineſſe is from above, and it conſiſteth in the ſweet fruition of God: this happineſſe we had in the ſtate of innocency; but we loſt it by the fall of our firſt Parents, and we have no means to recover it, but onely by Chriſt Jeſus our bleſſed Redeemer. Wherefore, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> God took pity on our miſerable condition, and of his infinite mercy and love <hi>hath not ſpared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> to work our redemption by his death and paſſion, and to bring us again into the favour of God. And as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:118343:162"/> not periſh; but have everlaſting life;</hi> ſo that we cannot have this true bleſſedneſſe, but onely by Chriſt, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where ſet forth in this Treatiſe. Thus doth the boundleſſe mercy and unlimited goodneſſe of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in offering his dear Son to all that will come and imbrace him: but ſome cannot come, becauſe they live not where the Goſpel of Chriſt is preached, which doth reveal him, and muſt inſtruct them in the right way how to finde him; ſome will not come, but make excuſes, <note n="c" place="margin">Lu. 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Conſider now, that riches honours, and lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not in themſelves ſimply evill: for they are Gods good creatures and his bleſſings; neither do they keep us from coming unto Chriſt; but we may injoy Chriſt together with them, if we do not immoderately covet them, and uſe no unjuſt means to get them, or put our truſt and confidence in them to derogate from the honour of God. If we injoy Chriſt with them, he will ſanctifie them to us for our comfort, and will make them the firſt fruits of our happineſſe, whereby we may glorifie God, and do much good to our neighbour: otherwiſe they are but the ſhadow of happineſſe, and not the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, which in the end will be bitterneſſe, when we muſt give a ſtrict account unto God how we have uſed them. Many a poor man that injoyeth Chriſt is more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his poverty, than they that abound in wealth and honour, if they are without Chriſt; for they injoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented minde, peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, and they have an holy aſſurance that their joy and happineſſe ſhall be made perfect in the life to come. Wherefore he that hath Chriſt, hath the Fountain of all true happineſs, and ſome ſtreams thereof will flow to him even in this life.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:118343:163"/>
               <p>But this is true which Chriſt ſaith, <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 6. 44</note> 
                  <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> and we can have no part in Chriſt, nor happineſſe by him, except we do truly believe in him. This is the way that God himſelf hath taught us, <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Alſo, this is the ſame way which Chriſt taught his Diſciples, <note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 14. 1</note> 
                  <hi>Yee believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Our faith muſt be as firm, as ſtrong, and as well grounded upon Chriſt, as he is our Redeemer, God and Man, as it is upon God alone, or elſe we cannot injoy him, and all that happineſſe which floweth from him. Though we dare not approach neer unto God in regard of his divine juſtice; yet through the mediation of Chriſt our gracious Redeemer, we may have free acceſſe unto our God, and we ſhall find him ſitting upon his Throne of mercy ready to receive us.</p>
               <p>If our faith doth reach no further than to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, what he is in his divine nature, and what he is by incarnation; or to his glorious excellencies and dignities, as he is the Mediatour of the new Covenant; or to the work of mans redemption, as he is the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the world; it is but the bare notion of faith, which is not effectual enough to bring us to eternal happineſſe. Unregenerate men may know and believe thus much of Chriſt by the letter of the Goſpel, and yet never be brought into the ſtate of grace by Chriſt, becauſe they have not the grace of faith in their hearts, to apply theſe things to themſelves. The devils did know who Chriſt was, they knew the purity of his nature, and what power he had over them, and yet they continued devils ſtill. Wherefore we muſt not reſt in the bare notion of faith, but if we will believe unto ſalvation, we muſt then, <note n="f" place="margin">John 13. 8, 9.</note> As <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſaid to the Jaylor, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we muſt reſt upon him, and put our whole confidence in him for our ſalvation: alſo, we muſt apply him, and all his excellent dignities to our ſelves, that we
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:118343:163"/> may be well perſwaded of our redemption by him, and that we are inveſted into the Covenant of grace by our union with him, and that we ſhall hereafter injoy the perfection of true happineſſe.</p>
               <p>If our Faith can reach thus high, and lay ſuch hold upon Chriſt by their particular application of him, then let our condition be what it will, we ſhall be happy while we live, more happy when we dye, and moſt happy after death: for no afflictions or ſorrowes of life, and no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or extremity of ſickneſſe in death ſhall be able to take this happineſſe from us, and after death we ſhall be out of the reach of all our enemies: for Chriſt, by whom we have this happineſſe, will not ſuffer us to looſe it; but by the grace and power of faith we ſhall ſtill draw all ſpiritual comfort from Chriſt to our ſouls, to make us truly happy in this life, and everlaſtingly happy in the life to come.</p>
               <p>This is the grace and power of true faith, to apply particularly to our ſelves whole Chriſt, God and Man, and as he is our Prophet, our high Prieſt, our King, our Mediator and Redeemer, and then how mean ſoever our condition be, he will make us happy in it, and will crown us with everlaſting happineſſe hereafter: for where this Faith is wrought, there the holy Ghoſt will abide for ever, and that ſoul muſt needs be happy, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth him. <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>For after that we have believed in Chriſt, we are ſealed with that holy Spirit of Primiſe unto the day of Redemption; this Spirit of promiſe is the earneſt of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which Chriſt haſt purchaſed for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider further, that by this means we are neerly joyned unto Chriſt: <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>For Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by Faith.</hi> This ſpirituall union with Chriſt is more firm and cloſe, than the union of the members of the natural body is with the head, or the union of the branches is with the vine: for nothing can ſeparate us from Chriſt, but he will keep us by his Almighty power unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:118343:164"/>
               <p>If we be in this bleſſed condition, nothing can hurt the well-being of our ſouls, but all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our good. What comfort and what happineſſe can we want, if we injoy Chriſt? His grace will carry us on cheerfully through all the diſcomforts that we ſhall meet with in this life his bleſſings will be upon all that we injoy, and he will give us the fulneſſe of happineſſe in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Though we be in Chriſt, yet we ſhall meet with many ſorrowes, troubles and vexations in this life, which will cloud the ſenſe of this our f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherefore, we ought ſeriouſly to meditate and ſtudy how to injoy Chriſt, who is the true happineſſe of our ſouls; and though we have but a taſte of this heavenly conſolation; yet it will ſweeten the bitterneſſe of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and as we dayly grow in grace, ſo we ſhall day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde more comfort by our aſſurance of the fruition of our future felicity in heaven.

               <p>THe true knowledge of this high Principle of Religion, what it is to be juſtified in the ſight of God, and how it is wrought in us by the holy Ghoſt, is of great concernment to every true Chriſtian, and it doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter exceeding much comfort to him in the aſſurance of the pardon of his ſins, and in the hope of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:118343:164"/>
               <p>Now we are juſtified, not for any inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in us, nor for any foreſeen works we are able to do, nor for any grace that is wrought in us; but as God doth elect us of his own free grace and love; ſo he doth alſo freely juſtifie us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> by not imputing our ſins and iniquities to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by not inflicting the condemnation of ſin upon us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by imputing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to us by faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by pronouncing and declaring us to be juſt in the Court of heaven, and by witneſſing the ſame to our conſciences by his holy Spirit; and laſtly by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptation of us.</p>
               <p>This is our Juſtification, and thus we may be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it: for God hath ſet up his ſeat of Judgement in every mans conſcience; ſo that, when we remember our ſins, if our conſcience doth abſolve us by our faith in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and in the merit of his blood: it is a ſure evidence of our juſtification in the ſight of God: but if it doth condemn us, then it will binde us over to anſwer for our ſelves at the laſt and general judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it will bring bitter accuſations againſt us, and witneſſe terrible things againſt our poor ſouls: for conſcience is the higheſt witneſſe next under God.</p>
               <p>The ground of our juſtification is Gods free grace to us by Faith in Chriſt, who hath taken upon himſelf the guilt of our ſins. whereby they are imputed to him, and his righteouſneſſe is imputed to us; ſo that now God doth account us juſt and righteous, becauſe we have no guilt of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and therefore he will abſolve us from all our ſins, and from the puniſhment that is due to us for them, and he will pronounce us perfect and juſt againſt all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the devil, and clamours of our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; he will alſo accept of our perſons, not for any grace that is wrought in us, nor for the merit of any
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:118343:165"/> work that is done by us; but onely for the ſake of Chriſt, whom we do imbrace by faith, upon whom we reſt and depend, and under whoſe righteouſneſſe all our ſins are hidden and covered out of Gods ſight.

               </p>
               <p>Though we are juſtified onely by Faith, without the works of the Law; yet it is not by any property, vertue or power that Faith hath in it ſelf to juſtifie; but as it hath relation unto Chriſt, it being the ſole inſtrument to unite and knit us unto him with an unſeparable union, to be made one with him, and to be made pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now let us ſtudy and meditate with pure affections, how to reſt upon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and not upon our works: for if we truſt to our works, or glory in them, they will deceive us. Thus ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <hi>By the works of the Law can no fleſh be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Alſo, if we make our works copartners with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in our juſtification, then Chriſt
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:118343:166"/> will profit us nothing; for our works do conduce much to our ſanctification; but they have no place in our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
               <p>If we are not perſwaded that we are juſtified in the ſight of God, we can feel no comfort in Chriſt, no aſſurance of the pardon of our ſins, &amp; no ſtedfaſt hope of ſalvation. If the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be not imputed to us, our hearts cannot be ſeaſoned with grace, there can be no purity nor holineſſe of life, and we can do nothing that will pleaſe God. So likewiſe if the guilt of our ſins be not imputed unto Chriſt, that he may take it from us, it will ſtill reſt upon our ſoules, it will afflict and terrifie our conſciences, it will follow us unto judgement, and at laſt be a meanes to ſink us down into eternal deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But here is ſingular comfort for a poor diſtreſſed ſoul, that is under the buffetings of Satan, againſt all his feares and doubtings; that if he hath intereſt in Chriſt by faith, he may ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>THis faith is ſuch an excellent grace, that we may draw from it many ſingular benefits and comforts, if we make uſe of it upon all occaſions, and it doth alſo make us capable by Chriſt of eternal life hereafter.

What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can we have by the Word of God, if we doe not hear it with hearts purified from our corruptions by faith? how can it profit us, if there be not an holy preparation to receive it, that the holy Ghoſt may imprint it in our hearts, to be a word of power in us unto ſalvation, and to be the Savour of life unto eternal life? and how can it be fruitful in us to the reformation of our lives, if our hearts are not ſeaſoned with faith? <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> and then it is a ſpecial meanes which the ſpirit of God uſeth to convey ſpiritual knowledge to the underſtanding, holy deſires to the will, to ſtudy and endeavour to a godly life, and alſo true conſolation to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe our hearts are prepared by faith to the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper; for as we doe refreſh our bodies with the Bread and Wine; ſo our ſoules are refreſhed and comforted by our ſpiritual feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the body and blood of Chriſt by faith. Alſo, faith
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:118343:168"/> will put an holy zeal into our prayers, to make them fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and effectual to prevail with God, to ſend us a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer in his good time. Thus ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, <note n="k" place="margin">Mar. 11. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>What things ſoever yee deſire when yee pray; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ye receive them, and yee ſhall have them.</hi> O what comfort might we find in our prayers, when we are in want, ſorrow, or in any neceſſity, if we did pray with zealous affections, and did faithfully believe that our petitions are granted before we receive them; then we would wait upon God, until he is pleaſed to ſatisfie our deſires: for our faith will give us as certain aſſurance to obtain what we pray for, as if we did already injoy it. We have no hope of ſuccour in our diſtreſſes but by prayer, and no prayer is prevailing with God, but that which comes from a believing heart. The gift of prayer may move the affections for the preſent, but it is the grace of prayer that is powerful with God: the gift of prayer is but a common gift of the holy Ghoſt, which may be without faith, and conſequently without any acceptance: <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> but faith doth alwayes goe along with the grace of prayer, and God will not deny ſuch a prayer, though it be made in weak expreſſions; for the heart may ſigh out a faithful prayer, and grone out our deſires, which the tongue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter nor expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Now then look well to the purity of thine affections, and to the faithfulneſſe of thy heart, when thou art in the preſence of God to hear his word, that thy mind be not then about thy worldly affaires, or thy thoughts ſet upon vain things, if thou deſireſt to receive good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: For if thou doeſt hear it with an unbelieving heart, or full of worldly cares, then thy heart is like barren ground, where bryars and thornes grow, which cannot receive ſuch ſpiritual ſeed to bring forth fruit unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Alſo, in thy holy meditations on ſpiritual things, thy heart muſt be firſt purified by faith, or elſe thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:118343:168"/> will not be comfortable to thy ſoul, becauſe thou haſt not faith, which is the inſtrument to draw true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, when thou comeſt to the Lords Table, ſee there be faith in thine eyes to diſcern the Lords body in thoſe outward elements, that thou mayeſt ſpiritually feed on him, to nouriſh thy ſoul to eternal life.</p>
               <p>When thou makeſt thy ſupplications to God, believe faithfully that thou ſhalt receive what thou beggeſt, and then thy prayers will not return empty without a bleſſing. In like manner, if thy humiliation for thy ſinnes be not a fruit of faith, but onely in outward ſhew, and not in the ſincerity of thy heart, with true contrition and godly ſorrow for them, thy humiliation is no better <note n="m" place="margin">1 Kin. 21. 27.</note> than that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which produced no reformation of life.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if thou doeſt confeſſe thy ſinnes when any ſore affliction is upon thee, and doeſt not faithfully purpoſe to forſake them and turn to the Lord, thou doeſt diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God in thy heart, and canſt not believe that God will forgive them; for thy confeſſion is no better <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 9. 27, 28.</note> then that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and thou canſt have no comfort in ſuch repentance, becauſe it is not a fruit of faith: for it is onely faith that doth perfect all thy ſervices to God in their righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we have no defence againſt the temptations and wicked ſuggeſtions of the devill, and againſt the rage of our ſpiritual enemies, but the ſhield of faith; his fiery darts will wound our ſoules even to the death, <note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> if we doe not quench them in the bloud of Chriſt by faith; his temptations will pierce us to the heart, if we doe not beat them back with this impenitrable ſhield.</p>
               <p>Alſo, he layeth his ſnares every where ſo cunningly in our way, that we can hardly take a ſtep but we ſhall ſtep into a ſnare, <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 26. 11, 12.</note> if we doe not walk in our integriy by faith, that our feet may ſtand in an even place. There is no place ſecure, and no condition of life is free from the ſnares of the devill: he layeth them in our calling, upon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:118343:169"/> our table, in our chambers and cloſets, and under our feet; ſo that every ſtep we take out of the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is an occaſion to bring us into his ſnares, and we have no meanes to eſcape them, but to walk in the light of the Spirit of God, which we cannot have but by faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If we walk thus by the direction of his Spirit, then, as the wiſe man ſaith, <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 28. 18, 26.</note> we walk uprightly, and we ſhall be ſaved: we walk wiſely, and we ſhall be delivered. But if we have not this ſpiritual light to guide us, we walk in darkneſſe, <note n="r" place="margin">Job 18. 8, 9, 10.</note> we are <hi>caſt into a net by our own feet, and we walk upon a ſnare. The grin ſhall take us by the heel, and the robber ſhall prevail againſt us. The ſnare is laid for us in the ground, and a trap for us in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iſa. 50. 11.</note> if we walk in the light of our own fire, and in the ſparkes that we have kindled, this we ſhall have of Gods hand, we ſhall lye down in ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Thus do ſpirituall dangers continually attend us, which of our ſelves we cannot eſcape; but if we truſt in the Name of the Lord, and reſt our ſelves upon God by faith, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 91. 3</note> he will deliver us from the ſnare of the fowler, he will direct us in all our wayes, and will guide our feet into the way of peace: <note n="u" place="margin">Jer 10. 23</note> For <hi>the way of man is not in himſelf,</hi> as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>it is not in man that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to direct his ſteps.</hi> If we are taken in any of theſe ſnares that the devil layeth for us, we have no meanes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very but by faith and true repentance: for faith in Chriſt will break the ſnare, and repentance will draw us out of the pit which did threaten our deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Conſider again, that the devil laboureth to inſnare us with the alluring baits of pleaſure and profit, thereby to draw away our hearts and affections from God; this is a cunning way to deceive us: for we ſuſpect no danger and no evill in thoſe things unto which we are naturally inclined; ſo that we may eaſily be deceived with theſe guilded baits: for without a ſpiritual light we cannot ſee the hook that is in them, which will pull us into the pit of perdition.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:118343:169"/>
               <p>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14.</note> Thus the devil can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> to deceive, if it were poſſible, the very elect. The devil hath ſo many wayes to intrap us, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe thorough this dangerous ocean without ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, except Chriſt be our Pilot by faith to ſteer our hearts and affections, and all the faculties of our ſoules with his Spirit; and then we ſhall eſcape all theſe rocks and quickſands which doe continually threaten the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction of our poor ſoules. We cannot mount above this black cloud of deadly ſnares and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers without the wings of faith, and we cannot break the cords of ſin without the ſtrength of faith in the death of Chriſt, neither can we get out of the dominion of ſin, without the power of the ſame faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Such is the goodneſſe of our bleſſed Saviour to us, that he hath not onely given us the ſhield of faith for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt theſe ſpiritual enemies, <note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> but hath alſo furniſhed us with the whole armour of God, which we muſt put on, and buckle cloſe to us with the girdle of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity apprehended by faith, that we may be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devill. For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities and powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, and againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places. Alſo, Chriſt hath given us the wiſdom of his Spirit, ſo to uſe every piece of this ſpiritual armour, that neither by force nor by fraud the devill ſhall be able to hurt us, or to hinder the ſalvation of our ſoules. For Chriſt knew how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently we ſhould be aſſaulted, and the weakneſſe of our own ſtrength to reſiſt, and how cunningly our enemies would plot to undermine us; and therefore we ſhould need this ſpiritual armour to defend our ſelves, and to offend our adverſaries, and likewiſe his Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his almighty power to uſe that armour as we ought.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Faith doth much ſupport and comfort us in all
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:118343:170"/> the ſorrows and troubles of this life; for ſo long as we live in the fleſh we are ſubject to many tribulations and extremities, which we cannot patiently bear without the help of faith. Princes have their cares, the great men of the world are not free from troubles; there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life that can challenge a priviledge from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incumbrances and miſeries; againſt all which, faith doth comfort the ſervants of God in his promiſes, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from ſinking under their afflictions, by that vertue and power which they draw thereby from the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if we doe confide in the promiſes of God, and reſt upom them by faith, as made unto us; ſo that we can wait without murmuring Gods own time for the performance of them, they will then ſweeten our ſorrows, eaſe us in our troubles, comfort us in the afflictions of our ſoules, and give us an aſſured hope of deliverance out of our diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>The good Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> and the valient men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> obtained many great victories beyond humane expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they believed and reſted upon the word of promiſe which they had from the Lord. <note n="z" place="margin">Joſh. 11. 6, 8.</note> When <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaw divers Kings come againſt him he was afraid, but God did ſtrengthen him with the promiſe of victory, which he reſted upon, and God made his word good unto him. <note n="a" place="margin">Judg. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Baruch</hi> had the like promiſe againſt <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi> which the Lord did faithfully perform. <note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 20</note> 
                  <hi>Ahab</hi> had two great victories over the <hi>Syrians,</hi> though he were a wicked King, becauſe he reſted upon the promiſe of God. <note n="c" place="margin">1 Chron. 14. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> overcame the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> becauſe he believed the word of God. <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 8.</note> Alſo he recovered all the ſpoil that the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had taken out of <hi>Ziglag,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he truſted to the word of promiſe which he had from God. <hi>David</hi> did find by manifold experience, how faithful God was in the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which made him ſo much delight in the Word of God, and ſo often to meditate on his promiſes, which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:118343:170"/> did exceedingly ſtrengthen him in all his afflictions and troubles. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſa. 34. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 50. 15</note> 
                  <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Pſa. 42. 11</note> 
                  <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> Thus may a poor ſoul cheer up his drouping ſpirits, when his mind is perplexed, or when troubles and ſorrows com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe him about on every ſide, if he hath a word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from God to reſt upon.</p>
               <p>When God doth viſit us with afflictions, he hath then ſome work to doe in us for his own glory and for our good, and we muſt then make uſe of our faith, which will help us much to joyn with him in his own work, becauſe he intendeth our good thereby, and then he will the ſooner remove his rod of correction from us. We may underſtand what Gods purpoſe is, when his rod is upon us, if we mark and obſerve in what manner he doth viſit us; and alſo if we doe truly examine our ſteps, how we walk before God from day to day; for then we ſhall diſcover what good we have omitted, and what evill we have committed, and we ſhall find ſome ſweet motions of his Sprit to direct us what we ought to doe for the more ſpeedy effecting of his work in us. If our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth tell us of ſome particular ſinnes that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God againſt us, then he will puniſh us according to the nature of thoſe ſins.</p>
               <p>If we are too much addicted to the world he will viſit us with croſſes, loſſes, and troubles in our eſtate; if we are in danger of ſpiritual pride, he will pull us down with a thorn in the fleſh, or ſend a Meſſenger of Satan to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet us, <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:118343:171"/> to us in the end, if by faith in Chriſt we have not a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taſte of the love and goodneſſe of God to us. If God ſeeth us ſecure, or preſuming upon our own ſtrength, he will withdraw his aſſiſting grace, and ſuffer us to fall into many temptations, and into groſſe ſins, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> to make us more watchful over our wayes, and to depend more upon him.</p>
               <p>Thus we may find what God intendeth when we are under his viſitation: for then God calls for true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and repentance for that very ſin, which he hath diſcovered to us, and a true turning from it unto God, with a faithful indeavour to better obedience; and then he will forgive our ſin, and heal our diſeaſe by faith in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if our conſcience doth clear us, and yet Gods viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is upon us, it is then to exerciſe us under the croſſe, to be made conformable unto Chriſt our head in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or to try our faith, our patience, our hope and affiance in God, and what conſtancy we have to continue faithful to the end, though God ſhould delay to remove the croſſe from us, all which do tend to the glory of God and to our own good. <note n="i" place="margin">John 9. 3</note> The man in the Goſpel was blind from his birth, and yet neither he nor his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had ſinned, but it was, that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God doth ſometimes viſit us with afflictions, to ſtir us up to more frequency and fervency of prayer, untill we are delivered out of our troubles. Howſoever; or to what end ſoever God doth viſit us, our faith in Chriſt will ſtand us in great ſtead, to ſupport us in our ſufferings and tryals, and to make the right uſe of all Gods dealings with us, that our ſoules may receive profit and comfort thereby.</p>
               <p>If we did live in ſad and mournful times, when we could ſcarcely ſee any thing but oppreſſion, injuſtice, rapine and wrong, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſ 82. 2, 3</note> when the Judges <hi>judge unjuſtly,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>and accept the perſons of the wicked, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:118343:171"/> doe not defend the poor and fatherleſſe, nor doe juſtice to the afflicted and needy:</hi> when the Church of God is under affliction, and torn in pieces by perſecutors and ſpoilers, with ſects and ſciſmes, and the ſincere Word of God corrupted with humane inventions, or elſe troden down by the authority of unjuſt men: then were the time to live by faith, and to ſtrengthen our faith with firm hope, that God will ariſe, as the ſame Pſalmiſt ſaith, and judge the earth, and will ſend deliverance to his Church in his good time, and that he will awake, as a Gyant out of ſleep, to avenge the deſolations thereof, and the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his people. In the mean time we ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe that ſuffer in our prayers, and comfort our ſelves with faith in the promiſes of God, waiting with patience for the ſalvation of God, when he will viſit his people in mercy, and remember what his Church hath ſuffered, and by whom, to render to every man according to his works.</p>
               <p>Among many calamities that God doth ſometimes bring upon a nation, or a people, to humble them for their ſinnes, to rouſe them up out of ſecurity, to pull down their pride, and to break their ſtubborn hearts, this is one of the greateſt, when he doth take away the pillars of his Church, and doth ſuffer it to be underpropt with weak meanes: for though it may ſtand for ſome ſhort time, yet it cannot continue long; for if the winds doe blow, or the billows of the ſea riſe againſt it, they will ſhake it, and much indanger the fall of it. This was <hi>Davids</hi> requeſt unto God in the like caſe, <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth, for the faithfull fall from among the children of men.</hi> When we ſee theſe things come to paſſe we had need cry mightily to the God of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for his help, for they are fore-runners of great calamities. But we truſt that God will not bring ſuch viſitations upon us, but that he will pitty us, as a father pittieth his child upon his ſubmiſſion to his will, though by reaſon of our ſinnes and rebellions againſt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:118343:172"/> his ſacred Majeſty, we have deſerved no pity.</p>
               <p>Now then, if theſe things be well conſidered, thou wilt find, that whatſoever thy condition of life be, that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and troubles will daily attend thee, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of thy nature will break out upon thee, to make thee fail of thy duty to God, to make thee yeild to ſinful motions, and to fall ſometimes into groſſe ſinnes, and ſo to looſe the ſenſe of Gods grace and favour, which doth more perplex the ſoul of a true Chriſtian, than to ſuffer the greateſt miſeries; but here is thy comfort, that if thou haſt faith in Chriſt, thou wilt reſt upon him; for he will ſupport thee in all thy ſorrows, he will free thee from all thy ſinnes, and will procure thy pardon upon thy true repentance, and he will bring thee again into the favour of God by the merit of his bloud. Nothing can make thee ſo unhappy, and ſo comfortleſſe, but that true faith well grounded upon Chriſt, and upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, will take away the apprehenſion of thy unhappineſſe, and will give thee true conſolation in the aſſurance of the love and favour of God to thee in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Faith will give us comfort in all the pious actions of our life: for by our union with Chriſt, God will accept for his ſake both of our perſons and of our works, whether they be works of piety to God, or works of charity to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>That our works may be ſuch as God requireth, firſt, the Word of God muſt be our rule to teach us to frame our actions according to the will of God, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conceit of our own fancie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our works muſt be ſuch as come within the compaſſe of our calling, either publick or private, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have no ground to believe that God will accept them. <note n="m" place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, our Adoption by Faith in Chriſt will ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move us to perform good works and holy duties out of a filiall love to God, and not out of a ſlaviſh fear, to do them willingly in obedience to Gods command, and not upon conſtraint; alſo, with an holy zeal, and not with a blinde devotion, <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 17. 24.</note> like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who <hi>worſhipped an unknown God.</hi>

                  <hi>for the Lord conſidereth all our works.</hi> Thus God ſaith by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Prov. 23. 26.</note>

                  <hi>God loveth a chearfull giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Faith will make us conſtant in well-doing, which will crown all our good actions with gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that we have reſpect, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6.</note> as holy <hi>David</hi> had <hi>to all Gods Commandements;</hi> then if we do our beſt endeavour in Gods ſervice, though we fail of our duty, or fall through frailty and infirmity; <note n="u" place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> God in mercy will heal our backſlidings, and will accept of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect performances, becauſe we have relation un to Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:118343:173"/>
               <p>Now then if we will ſtrictly examine the actions of our lives by thoſe former directions, we ſhall eaſily find whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our works and ſervices to God have been ſuch as he requireth, and performed according to his will, that we may have peace of conſcience in them here, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal comfort by them hereafter. If we can find by this inquiry, that our works have been the fruits of Faith, and that we have done our duty to the beſt of our power with a faithful heart to the honour of God; and not out of pride or vain-glory, to get the praiſe of men, as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do, or to any other by-end, then our Faith will ſhine forth in our works, and God will graciouſly accept them.</p>
               <p>But if the actions of our life have been evill, they will follow us for evill, when we lye down, and when we riſe up, and whitherſoever we go. If we ſleep or wake, they will moleſt and trouble us, they will aggravate our ſorrowes in our afflictions, and our pains in ſickneſſe, they will imbitter all the comforts of our life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fear and terrour of death, for they will come into our remembrance, when we ly upon our death-beds, to vex and terrifie our very ſouls, and to make us unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any heavenly conſolation, untill the guilt of ſin that cleaveth to them be taken away by Faith in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo, <note n="u" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13</note> our evill works will follow us unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to accuſe us before the great and dreadful Judge, <note n="x" place="margin">Rev. 20. 13</note> and then God will judge us according to them: if they be found wicked and ſinful, we cannot but expect the dreadful ſentence of condemnation to be pronounced againſt us. Alſo, after judgement they will increaſe our torments in hell, if we do not prevent it in time by our true repentance while we live here in this life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Faith will fit and prepare us for a bleſſed and a comfortable death: for by it we ſhall ſteer the whole courſe of our lives to the honour of <note n="y" place="margin">Col. 1. 10.</note> God, &amp; it will make
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:118343:173"/> us fruitfull in every good work, that they may be rightly done, both for the matter, and for the manner, and alſo to the right end, as God hath appointed them: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then but live vertuouſly and piouſly in the true fear of God, and he will reward us of his free bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though not of merit. God will remember our works if they are done in ſincerity, and in truth; to comfort us in the ſadneſſe of our hearts, to eaſe us in the extremity of pain, and ſickneſſe, and to give us a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and a quiet conſcience in the aſſurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins, and of his grace and favour, before the hour of our diſſolution ſhall come upon us. Such good works will adorn our profeſſion, and make our lives comfortable to us, and our converſation ſutable to our profeſſion, and they will follow us for our good whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever we go: for there is no guilt of ſin that cleaves to them, becauſe Chriſt hath taken it a way; whereof we are fully perſwaded by Faith. <note n="z" place="margin">Neh. 13. 14.</note> If we can with good <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> put God in remembrance of our good deeds, how will it ſtrengthen our hope and truſt in God, for his protection in all dangers, for his help and ſuccour in all our diſtreſſes, and for his aſſiſtance when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any ſpeciall buſineſſe? what ſweet conſolation will it be to us, when we are upon our death-beds, if with a clear conſcience we can put God in minde, <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 38. 3.</note> as King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, that <hi>we have walked before him in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in his ſight?</hi> If we thus live, and thus dye, we may then ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 14 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we dye we dye unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or dye we are the Lords.</hi>

                  <hi>John heard a voice from heaven ſaying unto him, Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, ſaith the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may confidently believe that their condition is moſt bleſſed; becauſe it is the voice of the ſpirit of truth that doth affirm it.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:118343:174"/>
               <p>We have alſo great encouragement to be fruitfull in good works; becauſe they will go with us even to the Tribunall ſeat of God: for Chriſt hath faſtned them to our ſouls, that God may then look upon them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them for the increaſe of our joy and happineſſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>If we do now ruminate well upon all theſe ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent benefits and comforts that come by a true and lively faith in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, we may draw ſweet and heavenly Meditations from thence for the comfort of our ſouls againſt the power of the devill, the rigour of the Law, the dominion of ſin, the fear of death, and againſt eternal condemnation. For we ſhall finde, that hereby we are ingrafted into Chriſt, who hath redeemed us from all iniquity, and from whatſoever our ſins have made us lyable unto, and hath cleanſed us from all the pollutions and defilements of ſin, he hath made us the adopted ſons of God, and hath given us all the priviledges that do belong unto Sons. Alſo, we ſhall finde, that by Chriſt we are inveſted into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and have right to all the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, which will ſweetly refreſh our ſouls in all fears and doubtings, in all difficulties and dangers, in all extremities and diſtreſſes, if we can apply them to our ſouls by Faith, and reſt upon them with ſtedfaſt hope.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let this be the Meditation of our hearts, and the deſire of our ſouls, to have a near communion with Chriſt, that we may ſay with the Spouſe, <note n="d" place="margin">Cant. 2. 16</note> 
                  <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, and I am his;</hi> or to ſay thus with <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt; Nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This particular application of Chriſt to our ſelves will draw from him the richeſt Jewels that are in his Treaſury; the richeſt robe, and the beſt garments that are in his
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:118343:174"/> Wardrope, and his very heart-blood for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>If we look a little lower, and fix our Meditations upon the holy Ordinances of God, we ſhall finde that which will ſweetly comfort and delight our hearts, if we have Faith to underſtand and believe what the holy Ghoſt ſaith to us in them for our inſtruction and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>It was Davids delight to Meditate on the Law of God, becauſe he found great ſweetneſſe in it. <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 163.</note> 
                  <hi>How ſweet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are thy words unto my taſte? Yea, ſweeter than hony to my mouth</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we had <hi>Davids</hi> ſpiritual palate, <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 58. 13.</note> we ſhould delight in the Lords Sabbath, as he ſaith by his Prophet, we ſhould delight to hear his Word, to come to his holy Table, to meditate on his Law, and to practiſe all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties to the honour and glory of his Name. Alſo, if we do ſet our ſelves to Meditate on the ſtrength and power of his grace, we ſhall finde that Faith will give us ſufficient power againſt all our ſpiritual enemies; hope will uphold our Faith in the promiſes of God, when it is weak; patience will make us bear our afflictions and tryalls with a willing minde; holy zeal will make our Prayers effectual to prevail with God to grant what we deſire, or what is better for us; and conſtancy will make us continue in well-doing unto the end, that we may receive that recompence of reward, which God of his infinite goodneſſe hath promiſed. As Faith is the Mother of all other ſpiritual graces, ſo it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes go along with every particular grace, to make it the more effectual and powerful to help us in time of need.</p>
               <p>Now we know the quickneſſe of our ſpirituall taſte by our delight in holy duties, and in the Ordinances of God; and we may know the ſtrength of grace by the fruits and effects of it, according to the nature of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace; alſo the truth of every grace that is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:118343:175"/> in us will appear, and that it is a fruit of Faith, if the power of Faith goeth along with it.</p>

                  </gap> weakeſt in Faith, may be made ſtronger, and he that is ſtrong in Faith may yet have more; for it is a ſpiritual and heavenly grace which will grow and increaſe, if it be ſpiritually watered by the holy Ghoſt. Chriſt did find a great Faith in the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in ſome others. <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 15. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>O woman,</hi> ſaith he to her, <hi>great is thy faith.</hi> but he did often reprove his Diſciples for the weakneſſe of their Faith; and thus he ſaid in particular unto <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 14. 31</note> 
                  <hi>O thou of little faith; wherefoer didſt thou doubt? Peters</hi> doubting made him ready to ſink, as he walked upon the waters unto Chriſt, and it did diſcover the weakneſſe of his Faith and confidence in Chriſt, as if he could not give him power to walk upon the waters as he did.</p>
               <p>This is the condition of many of Gods dear ſervants, that when they ſee perills and dangers ready to fall upon them, and no means either to eſcape them, or to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from them; then fears and doubtings will riſe in their mindes, to diſcover the weakneſſe of their Faith, and to make them diſtruſt the providence of God, to doubt of his Fatherly care of them, and of his Almighty Power to ſave them. For ſometimes their Faith may be ſo weak, that it cannot mount above their humane capacity, &amp; they cannot ſee the wiſdom, and power of God to be far above the reach of their reaſon and underſtanding. When God ſeeth ſuch weakneſſe in our Faith, he will tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſite us, and will give us hope by ſome manifeſt ſignes to ſtrengthen our faith againſt all our fears and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:118343:175"/>
               <p>Though our faith be weak, yet if it be true, it is ſaving, it is growing, and it is laſting, Faith is ſaving, becauſe it doth unite us unto Chriſt with an unſeparable union, who is the rock of our ſalvation, and by whom onely we muſt be ſaved. <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 4. 11, 12.</note> Chriſt is that ſtone which was ſet at nought of the builders, which is bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me the head of the corner: Neither is there ſalvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved. Alſo, we may grow in faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> if we deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, as new born babes deſire the milk of the breaſt, that we may thereby grow in the knowledge of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. If the word of God be purely Preached without the mixture of erroneous doctrine, it is the ſeed of grace, which God ſoweth in our hearts by his Miniſters, and he will water it with his Spirit, to make it increaſe and fructifie, that we may grow in grace, until we come to a full ſtature in Chriſt, if we do hear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with ſanctified hearts, and pure affections.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may greatly increaſe our faith in Chriſt, if we do ſpiritually feed upon his body and blood, when we come to the Lords Table, which is the true food of our ſouls, and the heavenly nouriſhment of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, which we have in Chriſt by Faith; and the oftner we do thus feed at the Lords Table, the more we cheriſh this ſpiritual life, and the more we increaſe our Faith, and make all other ſaving graces the ſtronger in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, prayer is a ſpeciall meanes for the increaſe of our Faith, for we have the beginnings of Faith from God, the increaſe of it alſo, and the ſtabliſhment of it is from God, and we muſt beg it of him by our Prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, or elſe we cannot obtain it. Thus ſaid the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles unto Chriſt, <note n="e" place="margin">Lu. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith.</hi> Alſo, thus ſaid the Father of the dumb childe unto Chriſt, <note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 9. 24</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> God is ready to hear the Prayers of his ſervants; but ſpecially when they make ſuch peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:118343:176"/> as he is willing to grant, which are ſuch as do make moſt for his own glory; and nothing can advance the glory of God more than when they crave the increaſe of their Faith, without which they can glorifie God in no ſervices which they perform unto him: for without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and ſo conſequently to honour him in any holy duty which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Faith will grow and increaſe by our dayly Meditation on the Truth of Gods Word, how faithfully he hath performed all his Promiſes, how ready and how able he is ſtill to perform them, if we can reſt and depend upon them by Faith. If we conſider that God is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and omnipotent in his own Eſſence, that he is Truth it ſelf, that he will not alter whatſoever he hath decreed in his ſecret Counſel, and that he will perform all that he hath promiſed in his Word, it will greatly ſtrengthen our Faith, and uphold our truſt and confidence in God, when any difficulties or dangers preſſe hard upon us, which otherwiſe would ſhake the foundation of our faith.</p>
               <p>Fifthly the dayly experience which we have of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, and of his goodneſſe to us in all conditions of life, whether we be in proſperity or in adverſity, in health, or in ſickneſſe, under the croſſe, or under the buffetings of Satan; this will much increaſe our Faith, and confirm our hope and confidence in God. <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 37.</note> This conſideration made <hi>David</hi> bold to encounter with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> that great Gyant, becauſe God had formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him from the paw of the Lyon, and from the paw of the Bear, and therefore he would now deliver him from that uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine.</hi> We ſhould make the ſame uſe of the former experience that we have any way had of the goodneſſe and mercy of God to us, to ſtrengthen our faith and affiance in God, when we are in any diſtreſſe, and can ſee no means to give us any hope of ſafety or of deliverance.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:118343:176"/>
               <p>Sixthly, if we be of low eſteem in our own eyes, and poor in ſpirit, to walk humbly before God in a true ſight and ſenſe of our unworthineſſe, and of our emptineſſe of grace and goodneſs; then God will give us more grace, more holy zeal, and he will make us rich in faith, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> for <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Thus we may have more ſtrength of Faith from God; becauſe he will deal like a tender father with theſe that know their own weakneſſe, to ſupply their wants with a gracious increaſe of their Faith: <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 42. 3.</note> for, <hi>he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> neither will he require of the weak ſo much as of theſe that are ſtrong in Faith, and whatſoever he requireth of them, he will give ſuch abilities of grace, as ſhall make them able to perform it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if we deſire to have our Faith increaſed, we muſt take heed that we give no liberty to ſin: for that will weaken our Faith, it will ſtop the influence of grace to our hearts, and hinder the free operations of the holy Ghoſt in us. How can we confide and truſt in Gods mercy and goodneſſe, when we have deſerved his wrath and diſpleaſure for ſome ſin that doth over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> power us without repentance? How can grace be ſtrong in us; if ſin doth ſtill reign in our mortall bodies? There can be no increaſe of Faith, if ſin be ſtrong in us. If God is pleaſed to try our faith, or any other grace that is in us, as he did <hi>Abraha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherefore now, if thou art conſcious of the weakneſs of thy Faith, by thine inability to reſiſt any temptation, or provocation unto ſin, by thy wavering and doubting in the true performance of Gods Promiſes, if they are above thy capacity, and by thy perplexed fears, when troubles or dangers are ready to ſeize upon thee; thou muſt not look upon thine own deſervings, except i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:118343:177"/> for thy humiliation: for thou muſt know that God did not make his gracious promiſes for thy ſake, though they were made for thy good; but God made them to thee for the ſake of Chriſt, in whom was the perfection of all merit, <note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor, 1. 20</note> 
                  <hi>and in whom all the Promiſes of God are, yea, and Amen;</hi> ſo that if thou art in Chriſt, thou haſt no cauſe to queſtion the performance of any of Gods promiſes. Alſo, for the increaſe of thy Faith meditate piouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe former directions, and then have recourſe by Prayer to thy bleſſed Saviour, and he will uphold thy Faith againſt all adverſary power that ſhall oppoſe it. But if thou art not in Chriſt, no promiſe of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto thee, and thou canſt finde no comfort therein.</p>

               <p>But the Faith of a true Chriſtian is fixed upon Chriſt, and upon no other object, who is a ſure rock to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it reacheth up to heaven, even to God himſelf, and it will fetch down help and ſuccour, comfort and conſolation from him upon all occaſions when we need it. <hi>Jude</hi> calls it <note n="f" place="margin">Jude 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>moſt holy faith;</hi> becauſe it maketh us holy in the ſight of God, by putting upon us the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and becauſe by it, as it hath relation unto Chriſt, our Prayers and all other our ſervices to God are holy and acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeeing Faith is ſo precious, that God will beſtow it upon none but upon his own children, and ſo holy that it maketh all our ſervices to God to be holy, we ought to eſteem it as a pearl of great price, and to keep it as a moſt precious Jewell.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:118343:178"/>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhould highly prize our Faith, becauſe it is the principall grace that the holy Ghoſt worketh in our hearts, and it maketh all other graces profitable, and effectuall to us according to their ſeverall natures. Our repentance is not ſound and true, if it be not a fruit of Faith: for we cannot truly humble our ſelves before God, and freely confeſſe our ſins unto him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, if we do not look upon him as our mercifull Father, by Faith in Chriſt, that we may have good hope of the pardon of our ſins; neither can we ſhew any fruits of repentance by mortifying the corruptions of our nature but by the vertue and power of Chriſts death, which we muſt draw to our ſelves by Faith, and alſo by our regeneration to newneſſe of life, but by the power of his reſurrection, which we muſt alſo have by faith. Our repentance can give us no holy aſſurance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſins, if we do not believe that Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for them all by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his death. <note n="g" place="margin">Lu. 21. 19</note> We cannot poſſeſſe our ſouls in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience when we ſuffer afflictions and tribulations, and when we are under the croſſe, if we do not belive that Chriſt hath ſanctified our ſufferings to make them work for our good, and that <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 14. 22</note> 
                  <hi>through much tribulation we muſt enter into the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> We cannot love God with true filiall love, nor obey him with filiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and fear, if we are not perſwaded of our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt by Faith. <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 10. 42</note> Our works of charity will not be accepted, unleſſe they are done in Faith, as to the Diſciples of Chriſt, and then we ſhall not loſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Thus doth Faith put life and vigour into all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make them effectuall and powerfull for our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and for the ſpirituall comfort of our ſouls, which is a ſpecial conſideration to make us account of our faith as a principall Grace, without which we can have no hope of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 13. 46</note> Faith is that Pearl of great price, which the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:118343:178"/> Merchant man in the Goſpel found, and ſold all that he had to buy it: for no humane learning, no abilities of nature, no wealth, or riches can purchaſe; we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our truſt in all theſe before we can buy this rich pearl: for it is above the ſtrength of nature to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and no power of men or Angels can procure it; but we muſt have it of the holy Ghoſt, he keeps it in his own power, and we may have it of him without money and without price, if in the true humiliation of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits we beg it of him. But if we ſeek to buy this pearl of the world, we ſhall pay dear for it, and yet not have the right Pearl; the luſtre of theſe pearls can reach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the object of the eye; but the luſtre of this true Orientall Pearl will ſhine in all dark places of woe and miſery, and it will pierce the very heavens to the eye of God himſelf. Notwithſtanding we do ſo highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the pearls that nature or this world doth afford us, that we will take any pains, or be at any coſt to gain ſome of them, though they are of no worth to reſt upon, when we are in any ſpirituall miſery whatſoever; but as for this precious Pearl we are loath to part with any thing for it, that by nature is near, or dear to us, or wherein we take pleaſure and delight. Thus we delude our ſelves with vain hopes, and we reſt upon that which cannot help; becauſe we know not the worth of true Faith, to make it the inſtrument of our truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let this conſideration alſo advance the eſtimation of Faith in our hearts and affections; becauſe by it we gain Chriſt with all his excellencies, and in Chriſt we gain the injoyment of the grace and favour of God, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of eternall ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if this be the tranſcendent worth of true Faith, we ſhould then with all care and diligence ſeek out where it is to be had, and labour by all means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. If God ſeeth this holy deſire in us, he will then give us to underſtand by his Spirit, that this rich pearl is
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:118343:179"/> no where to be found but in his own Cabinet; alſo, he will prepare our hearts and our will for it, he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint our eyes with ſpirituall eye-ſalve to finde it, and he will direct us to the means how we may obtain it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore we muſt know, <note n="l" place="margin">Eph 2. 8. 8.</note> that Faith is onely the gift of God, which he beſtoweth upon whom be pleaſeth, <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 1. 19</note> and he works it in us by his mighty power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God will give us hearts to ſeek it of him by fervent Prayer, which is a powerfull means to obtain any thing of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his Spirit will go along with the Preaching of his Word, that if we hear it with ſincere affections, it may work Faith in us: <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> for, <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, when we have found this precious Pearl in his Word, God will make us willing to buy it, though we give for it our ſouls, and all the faculties thereof, our hearts, our affections, and all the parts of our bodies; all which muſt be given up to the Lord, or elſe we cannot injoy true faith: and yet this is not all; for we muſt empty our ſelves of all conceit of our own worth, and quite renounce all confidence in worldly things, all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures, and every ſin that preſſeth us down, or that cleaveth cloſe to us, or elſe we cannot obtain this precious Pearl of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may conceive that Faith is of great eſtimation; becauſe it is ſo rarely found upon earth. Thus ſaith our Saviour Chriſt concerning Faith; <note n="o" place="margin">Lu. 18. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Son of man cometh, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> It is ſuch a rare Jewell as is ſcarcely to be found, few do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, and none can rightly eſteem of it, but onely ſuch as have it. <note n="p" place="margin">Rev. 2. 17.</note> Chriſt promiſeth to give <hi>a white ſtone to him that overcometh, and in this ſtone a new name is written, which no man knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> We cannot obtain this white ſtone of purity, righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe but by Faith; whereby we are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is this white
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:118343:179"/> ſtone; alſo, we ſhall know this new name that is written in it: for by Faith we ſhall put on Chriſt; and ſhall be made new creatures, to live as becometh new Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in newneſſe of life, and in uprightneſſe of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>It is true which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="q" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that all men have not faith,</hi> for there is ſo much wickedneſſe, fraud, deceit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief among men, that true faith can hardly be found; is it is written, <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 3. 10, 11.</note>

                  </gap>aith upon wrong objects, which will deceive them in the end: ſome upon falſe gods, as upon <hi>Aſhteroth, Chemoſh, Dagon, Belzebub:</hi> and the like, others put their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; truſt in the arm of fleſh, in ſtrong towers, or in the creature, as <hi>Senacherib, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and others: ſome again ground their faith upon their works; all which delude themſelves with vain hopes, thinking to find help and comfort in theſe falſe objects, where none can be expected. But the true object of this Divine grace is God himſelf, upon whom onely we muſt fix our Faith: for if we truſt in him we ſhall not be confounded. Many have the notion of Faith in their brain, but not the grace of Faith in their hearts, and many have the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, but not the vertue and power of it to lay hold upon Chriſt, and to make him their onely truſt and confidence. The Souldiers Faith is in his valour: for he believeth not that <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 144. 1.</note> God teacheth his hands to war, and his fingers to fight, and that he giveth victory to whom and when he pleaſeth. If the Magiſtrate did believe <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that he had his power and authority from God, to uſe it in juſtice and in truth, to whom he muſt give an account, how he hath relieved the oppreſſed, and how he hath judged the cauſe of the fatherleſſe and Widow, he would not then ſtrain the Lawes beyond their true meaning, nor pervert judgement for anjuſt ends. The rich mans confidence is in his wealth and goods, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,

                  <note n="u" place="margin">Lu. 12. 20</note> that this night they may be taken from him, or he from them. All theſe and many more come ſhort of true juſtifying faith, and therefore they know not the ſingular worth and eſteem of it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, it is evident that this heavenly grace is peculiar onely to the Elect of God, ſuch as are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſuch as are poor in ſpirit and humble minded, that know the worth of this precious Jewell, that do earneſtly ſeek for it, and uſe the right means to obtain it: theſe onely are willing and ready to apply themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by prayer and ſupplication, that he will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work it in their hearts by his Spirit, that it may be firmly grounded upon Chriſt, that onely he may be the Object of their Faith, in whom dwelleth all fulneſſe, and who onely is able to ſupport, help and comfort them in all their neceſſities, both ſpirituall and temporall; and as he is able, ſo he is as willing to do it. Wherefore they do renounce all other confidence, and they ſtick cloſe unto Chriſt, they reſt and depend upon him, uſing the means which he hath appointed to make their lives comfortable here, and eternally bleſſed in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the great eſtimation that we ought to have of Faith will appear by this conſideration, that the devill doth moſt oppoſe it, and ſeeketh by all means to hinder the working, and the growth of it in our hearts; becauſe it is the onely inſtrument of our ſalvation by Chriſt. We cannot conceive what ſtratagem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he will cunningly uſe to deceive us, and if it were poſſible to overthrow our faith. Firſt, he will aſſault us with temptations and evil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, as he did <hi>David,</hi> when he numbered the people, to make him truſt more in his own ſtrength, than in God. Secondly, he will labour by his ſubtile perſwaſions to keep us ſtill in unbelief, or elſe to make us preſume of ſalvation by the mercies of God without Faith in Chriſt. Thirdly, he will delude us with a temporary faith, which will not bear us out in ſtrong tryals and temptations, and ſo to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:118343:180"/> loſe the time, and opportunity that God doth give us for the obtaining of true ſaving Faith. Fourthly, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth bewitch us with the ſinfull delights and vanities of this world, to ſteal away our hearts from God, and to keep us from a firm truſt and confidence in him; or elſe to keep us under the ſlavery and bondage of ſome ſin, which will nip the fruits of our faith, and keep it from increaſe. Laſtly to further his wicked deſign, he will labour to hold us in ignorance and blindneſſe, that we ſhould not ſee our own miſerable condition, nor know how to get out of it.</p>
               <p>Thus the Devil doth ſet himſelf againſt Faith; becauſe upon it dependeth our hope of ſalvation, and becauſe it is the chief piece of our ſpirituall armour, to reſiſt and conquer him, and it is a ſhield ſo ſtrong, that his fiery darts cannot pierce it, to wound or hurt our ſouls. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt look well to our Faith, that the devil do not undermine it: for then he will rob us of theſe bleſſed fruits that come thereby. But our hope is in the promiſes of God, and in the interceſſion of Chriſt, as a ſure Anchor to uphold and ſtrengthen our Faith, that it fail not, though it be aſſaulted with much malice and violence.</p>
               <p>In all ages the Devil hath had his wicked inſtruments, which have turned many away from the Faith, and have oppoſed the Prophets and Miniſters of God, and have perſecuted thoſe that did profeſſe the Name of Chriſt, to make them forſake the Faith. <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> Thus he made the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent his inſtrument to deceive <hi>Eve.</hi>

               <p>This ſhould teach us the more highly to love and prize Faith; becauſe the devil ſo much hates it, and to ſtick the cloſer to it; becauſe he doth ſo much oppoſe it. This ſhould alſo teach us to love thoſe that wicked men hate, and to hate thoſe that they love: if we obſerve what they do moſt delight in, we ſhould hate their vice, and love the contrary vertue. If they delight in gluttony or riot, we ſhould hate that, and love temperance and ſobriety: if they take pleaſure in uncleanneſſe, then we ſhould love chaſtity. If they delight in pride, we ſhould delight in humility, and lowlineſſe of Spirit: they have ſo much of the devils nature in them, that they cannot truly love any thing that is pious and holy, becauſe it is that which God loveth; neither can they hate any thing that is wicked and ſinfull; becauſe it is ſo agreeable to their nature, and they have no grace to check their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature for loving that which God hateth, and hath forbidden: whereas a regenerate man will find that the Spirit of grace which is in him, will give him a ſecret check, if his unregenerate part doth take pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in any thing that is ſinfull: for he muſt not conform himſelf to the faſhion of the world.</p>

God doth ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from his dear ſervants, and doth ſuffer them to looſe the ſenſe of their Faith for a time, to make them prize it the more, and to be the more careful of it, this God will alſo do by laying his rod of correction heavy upon us, if he ſeeth that we watch not carefully over our Faith, that we are careleſſe in the uſe and exerciſe of it, that we ſleep in ſecurity, or lye dead in our ſins without repentance, or if we abuſe his love and goodneſſe to us: for then he will leave us to our ſelves, to let us ſee our own weakneſſe without his aſſiſting grace. Upon theſe and the like occaſions the devill will be ready to take his advantage, to aſſault us with his temptations, to make us doubt of the love and favour of God, when afflictions preſſe ſore upon us; alſo to aggravate our ſins, or elſe to hide them out of our ſight, as he did <hi>David</hi>'s ſin of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, if by any means he can, to keep us in unbelief, or without repentance, that we may not recover the ſenſe and comfort of our Faith: for his main drift is, at laſt to drive us into deſpair.</p>

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:118343:182"/> are overwhelmed with ſorrowes, or feel any ſpiritual deſertions; in ſo much as they cannot receive comfort, until the holy Ghoſt, who is the true Comforter, doth give them ſome aſſurance of the grace and favour of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is evident, that our Faith may be ſo ſtrongly aſſaulted with ſorrows and grief of heart, that we are not able to hold out, but are ready to ſink under the preſſure of our miſery, becauſe it will take away the ſenſe of our faith, which muſt uphold us; but ſpecially when the guilt of ſin lyeth upon the conſcience; for that will bring us to ſuch an apprehenſion of a ſpiritual deſertion, that we can feel no comfort in God for the time: for it will ſtop the current of all true conſolation to our afflicted ſpirits, which we cannot have but by Faith in Chriſt, and nothing will take impreſſion in us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, ſo long as we are under the guilt of ſin; but theſe or the like uncomfortable complaints will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be uttered, that God hath quite forſaken us, that there is no hope for us in Chriſt, and we cannot believe that there is any ſalvation for us, becauſe our ſins are ſo many and ſo grievous.</p>
               <p>If we are thus afflicted and perplexed in mind, that feares and doubtings of ſalvation trouble us, becauſe our Faith is ſo weak that we cannot diſcern it; this will give us great ſatisfaction and comfort, if we conſider that our ſalvation dependeth, not upon the ſtrength of our Faith, but upon the truth of it: for the weakeſt Faith, if it be true, is effectual to ſalvation, as well as the ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if we conſider that faith is a grace which is grounded upon a ſure rock, even upon Chriſt Jeſus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom no created power can prevail; and that the ſtrength of our Faith doth not conſiſt in our hold upon Chriſt: for then every temptation, or guſt of affliction, would make us let goe our hold, and ſo loſe it, but it conſiſteth in that firm and ſtrong hold that Chriſt

               <p>VVE are come now in the laſt place, through the aſſiſtance of Gods good Spirit, to the ſtability of faith, which will ſatisfie and comfort every diſtreſſed ſoul that is doubtful of his ſalvation, weak in faith, and afraid of death, and of the laſt judgement, through the wicked ſuggeſtions of the devil, and by the aggravation of their ſinnes. Though the apprehenſion of Gods anger will cloud the ſenſe of our faith, though afflictions will ſift it, and winnow it as wheat, though ſin will wound it, and the devil ſometimes foil it, yet nothing can kill it, and nothing ſhall be able to overthrow it; not the leaſt grain of Gods corn ſhall fall upon the earth; the habit of faith cannot be loſt, though we may looſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it for a time: for God hath given the gift of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to this faith, and to no other.</p>
               <p>So long as we live in the fleſh we are ſubject to many temptations and backſlidings from God, we are ready to fall into many groſſe and dangerous ſinnes, which will bereave us of all ſpiritual comfort for the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet our faith in Chriſt will appear again, and the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe will ſhine upon us, for Chriſt will not ſuffer us totally and finally to fall away from him; for our faith is built upon a ſure foundation, againſt which no violence of temptations, and no ſtormes of perſecution can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. <note n="a" place="margin">Lu. 6. 48.</note> Chriſt doth compare a righteous man to him that <hi>built an houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the floud aroſe, the ſtream beat vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently upon that houſe and could not ſhake it, for it was founded on a rock.</hi> Chriſt is the foundation of our faith, he is the rock of our ſalvation, <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 10. 30</note> and <hi>therefore,</hi> as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>we ſhall never be removed.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſheweth the ſtability of the faithful. <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 22</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul of his ſervants, and none of them that truſt in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:118343:184"/> him ſhall be deſolate.</hi> Alſo thus ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <note n="d" place="margin">Pſa. 125. 1</note> 
                  <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi> And to make this truth undeniable, thus ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <note n="e" place="margin">John 3. 16</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Why then ſhould we faint under any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation? Why ſhould we let goe the anchor of our hope? If we hold faſt to our faith, it will not deceive us, Chriſt wll not ſuffer us to depart from him for ever. If we ſin God will chaſtiſe us, and he will hide his face from us; but if we repent, amend, and turn unto him, he will have mercy on us, he will pity us, he will heal the bones which he hath broken, and will reſtore us again to the joy of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>There are divers ſound reaſons to prove the ſtability of faith in thoſe that belong unto Chriſt, that they ſhall never totally and finally fall away from grace; but they ſhall be raiſed up again by repentance, though they doe ſometimes fall into fearful and dangerous ſins.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is taken from Gods free election, which ever remaineth ſure and unchangeable; for what he hath decreed in his ſecret Counſel muſt ſtand firm, and cannot be altered. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29 33, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>God did foreknow ſome from eternity, whom he did elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, whom alſo he did effectually call, and them he juſtified in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and thoſe are ſure to be glorified: for who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect, whom he hath juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? who is he that condemneth? ſeeing Chriſt died for us, and is riſen again, and is now at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſsion for us:</hi> therefore he concludes, that <hi>nothing can ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Alſo the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in another place, <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> That <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:118343:184"/>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is drawn from the vertue and ſtrength of the Covenant of Grace. A Covenant between man and man is an ingagement of great force, and the ſervants of God did alwayes exactly keep it how ſtrong then is that Covenant, which God himſelf hath made with us, which his own dear Son hath ſealed with his bloud, and which God hath made of his own free grace and favour to us poor miſerable ſinners, which Chriſt hath procured for us? <note n="h" place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. 9.</note> God made a Covenant with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and he hath kept it to this day. Alſo God made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Covenants with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he performed them all. <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 21</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> made a Covenant with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and did preciſely keep it. This new Covenant is for ever, and it is ſo ſtrongly confirmed, that we cannot queſtion the performance of it on Gods part, whom in his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is immutable and unchangeable; and though we cannot perform our conditions to God, yet Chriſt hath performed them for us, and will alſo ſtabliſh us in the fear of God, that we ſhall never depart from him. Thus ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <note n="k" place="margin">Jer. 33, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them, even unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord, for I wil forgive their iniquity, and will remember their ſin no more.</hi> And again, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 32. 40</note> 
                  <hi>And I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing we have this Covenant of grace from God, and thus confirmed with the ſeal of Chriſts bloud, we may reſt confident, that if we are ingrafted into Chriſt by a true and lively Faith, we are then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted into this New Covenant, and every condition and Promiſe therein contained ſhall be performed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, which doth give us an holy aſſurance, that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:118343:185"/> we ſhall never totally and finally fall away from God.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon for the ſtability of the Faithfull is grounded upon the power of God; for as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>We are kept by the power of God, through Faith unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Lord Jehovah is our keeper, the Lord is our defence, all power is from him, and no created power can take us out of his hand. Chriſt is alſo our good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and we are his ſheep, though we go aſtray and wander out of the way in the Wilderneſſe of this world; yet Chriſt will not looſe us. but will ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m out of his hand. My father ſaith he, which gave them me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand</hi> Wherefore, if there be any confidence to be put in the Almighty power of God, if any truſt in the care of Chriſt over his flock, or any truth in his promiſes to his ſheep, we need not doubt of our perſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ance in grace, and in the truth, we need not fear the malice, the cunning, or the power of the Devil, that he can overthrow our Faith, or deſtroy the habit of it that is planted in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſtability of our Faith is firmly grounded upon the faithfulneſſe of God, according to this of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>And the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly; and I pray God, your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Faithfull is he that calleth you who alſo will do it.</hi> Alſo thus he ſaith, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye may he blameleſſe in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. God is faithfull, by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithfull God, which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandements to a thouſand generations.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> had great experience of Gods faithfulneſſe to him
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:118343:185"/> and therefore he ſaith, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 36 5.</note> that <hi>the faithfulneſſe of God reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the clouds.</hi> And again he ſaith, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy faithfulneſſe is unto all generations; thou haſt eſtabliſhed the earth, and it abideth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may therefore reſt upon the faithfulneſſe of God, as well as upon his power, for the keeping of his Covenant, for the performing of his Promiſes, for his aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in all our temptations: <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>for God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able: but will with the temptation alſo make away to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it.</hi> Alſo, in all our afflictions, miſeries and calamities that we ſuffer in a good Cauſe, God will keep and preſerve our ſouls from hurt, and therefore thus ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">1 Pet 4. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Let th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus ſaith the Lord unto his People, <note n="u" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I will betroth thee unto me forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and in judgement, and in loving kindneſſe, and in mercies, I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfuln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If we are thus betrothed unto God in faithfulneſſe, in judgement and in righteouſneſſe, then we cannot be quite ſeparated from him, and our Faith in Chriſt which, is the inſtrument of our betrothing, cannot be quite loſt.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon why the Faithfull cannot finally fall away from God, is taken from the love of God: <note n="x" place="margin">John 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hing can ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſaith <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt, <note n="z" place="margin">1 John 4. 10, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Again he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:118343:186"/> ſaith thus, <hi>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> Wherefore by our love to our neighbour we may know what love dwelleth in us, how we love God, and whether God dwelleth in us. If we be in this gracious condition, that God hath ſet his love upon us, we cannot then loſe this principall grace of Faith, which is the bond of Gods love to us; and we cannot fall quite away from God; becauſe <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4. 30</note> 
                  <hi>we are ſealed with the Spirit of God into the day of Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth reaſon is grounded upon the merits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt. This is a ſtrong reaſon ſo to ſtabliſh our Faith, that it ſhall never be overthrown, for by the merit of his blood we are redeemed out of the captivity of ſin and Satan; this was an infinite price which Chriſt paid for our redemption; whereby alſo we are freed from the curſe of the Law, and from the condemning power of ſin, becauſe we are made one with Chriſt by Faith. If therefore we can be brought again under the ſame bondage and ſlavery, or under the ſame curſe or condemnation of ſin, which we ſhall be if our union with Chriſt can be broken, then we ſhall have but little bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by our redemption, and Chriſt hath paid that great price for us to little purpoſe; alſo we are not then perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made free, but are ſtill the ſervants of ſin. But Chriſt hath finiſhed the whole work of our Redemption, the eternall ſon of God hath made us free, ſin hath therefore no more power over us, and the Devil cannot prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us to break that union which is between Chriſt and us by Faith.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this conſideration will much ſtrengthen our Faith againſt all oppoſition and adverſary power, that if we are redeemed by Chriſt, and made free by him, our ſtate and condition is firm and ſure, it cannot be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for Chriſt will looſe none of thoſe whom he hath bought with ſo great a price, and made free by his own power, and for whom he hath made interceſſion to his Father.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:118343:186"/>
               <p>If our Faith ſhould fail, then Chriſts interceſſion for us muſt fail, we ſhall then loſe Chriſt and all the benefits that come by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall loſe all true comfort in this life, and eternall bleſſedneſſe in the life to come. If we conceive thus meanly of the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt, it is blaſphemy in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh reaſon for the ſtability of Faith, is drawn from the nature of ſaving grace, which is in corrupt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Birth is wrought by the Spirit of God, and it hath a ſpirituall life by Faith in Chriſt, which can never dye, though it may lye gaſping for a time through ſome violent temptation, or ſore tryall: For if God begins to work a Work of Grace in us, he will not leave it, untill it be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>From hence we may draw great conſolation to our ſelves in the apprehenſion that we are weak in grace, for though we finde but the beginnings of our Regeneration wrought in us, God will not leave his own Work imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Though we cannot perform our duties and ſervices to God as we ought; yet God will accept the will for the deed in Chriſt, if it proceeds from a faithfull heart: and though we find but ſome parts of true repentance wrought in us, as to our own apprehenſion, God will go on in his Work of Reformation, untill there be a through change wrought both in ſoul and body, to newneſſe of life. If Faith, or any other ſpirituall grace be weak in us, it will grow ſtronger, it will increaſe and continue; becauſe the Holy Ghoſt will water his own ſeed which he hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:118343:187"/> with his ſpirituall dewes from above.</p>
               <p>The laſt reaſon for the confirmation of our Faith is this, becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth dwell in our hearts by faith, and where he doth ſettle his habitation, there he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide for ever. If our hearts are purified by Faith in the blood of Chriſt, then we are the ſpirituall Temple of God, and the Holy Ghoſt will dwell there, according to this of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16</note> 
                  <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">1 John. 4 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt is that true Comforter, whom Chriſt hath ſent from the Father to be with every Member of his Church, to dwell with them, to be in them, and to abide with them for ever; and where he is, there no grace can be wanting.</p>
               <p>If we injoy his comfortable ſociety he will then lead us into all truth; for he is the Spirit of Truth: no errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrine ſhall infect our ſouls, but we ſhall rightly underſtand the wayes of God, and be able in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to walk in them: He will protect us in all dangers, he will comfort us in all our ſorrowes, he will uphold our faith againſt all aſſaults and temptations, and will give us ſtrength of grace to hold out and perſevere in all our tryalls unto the end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore grieve not this holy Spirit, by whom we have ſo much comfort in all conditions of life, and by whom we are ſealed unto the day of redemption, who will confirm and ſtabliſh us in the Faith of Chriſt, that we may continue ſtedfaſt, untill we ſhall come to live and reign with our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt for ever in heaven</p>

               <head>The Concluſion of this Treatiſe.</head>
               <p>NOw for the Concluſion of this Work, I do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requeſt every Chriſtian Reader to enter into a ſerious conſideration with himſelf which way the thoughts of his minde are chiefly bent, and upon what he doth ſet the Meditations of his heart, that he may know whether his way be ſteered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven or not: for they do ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſt affect his ſoul, and plainly ſhew what is his chiefeſt joy and delight.</p>
               <p>If his thoughts are too much ſet upon the vanities of the world, then his heart cannot be Faithfull towards God, and there will be no place in his ſoul to receive that true comfort which otherwiſe he might have in the ſweet fruition of God by his pious and devout Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if he delighteth to ruminate upon his carnall pleaſures, or upon any other evill concupiſcence, or to call to remembrance with approbation his former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, he doth ſin over again thoſe former ſins, and doth defile his precious ſoul with uncleanneſſe and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; whereas both his ſoul and his body ought to be kept clean, and undefiled, that the holy Ghoſt may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell therein, and that his heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be alwayes fit for heavenly contemplations. So likewiſe if his chiefeſt ſtudy and care be to adorn his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſſe onely with a ſpecious form and fair outſide of purity and holineſſe, and doth not faithfully ſtrive to ſhew the power of it in his life and converſation he deludeth his own ſoul, and doth feed it with the meer ſhadow of conſolation, and not with the ſubſtance of ſound comfort which is onely found in the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>If theſe or the like be the meditations of our hearts,
<pb facs="tcp:118343:188"/> and if our affections keep at ſo far a diſtance from God, and from all true goodneſſe, that we have ſcarcely any thoughts tending that way; it is then no marvell if we miſſe the comfort which our ſouls deſire, when we are in any anguiſh of Spirit, or under the buffetings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and it is no wonder if we are ſad and caſt down, and go mourning all the day long, when the times are dangerous and full of troubles, and we can hear nothing but complaining in our ſtreets: for hereby we have no ſupport for our Faith, no Anchor for our hope, and no ſure rock to reſt upon, that our ſouls may be truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in the day of viſitation. Well may our ſpirits droup when we are peached with pain, or ſickneſſe, with wants, troubles, or afflictions, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruſt onely to earthly means and comforts: for we can finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, which will ſooner increaſe our ſorrowes, than comfort and ſupport us under them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we will refreſh our ſoul with true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fott, when they are preſſed with any ſadneſſe, or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, we muſt fetch our comfort from above, our delight muſt be to Meditate on heavenly things, our hearts and affections muſt be taken off from theſe things here below, and raiſed up to contemplate thoſe things which concern the Kingdom of Heaven. Chriſt and him crucified muſt be the ſubject of our Meditations, if we will have any ſpirituall conſolation, and the holy Ghoſt is the onely means to convey this comfort to our hearts from Chriſt: for he doth work all ſanctifying graces in us, which are as ſo many pipes wherein this heavenly liquor doth ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run down from Chriſt to us, and Faith doth faſten theſe golden pipes unto Chriſt, who is the Fountain of all true conſolation. Our repentance can give us no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Pardon of our ſins, unleſſe Faith doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it unto Chriſt, our hope can give us no comfort in the Promiſes of God, if Faith doth not faſten it unto Chriſt: our patience can give us no comfort in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb facs="tcp:118343:188"/> and tribulations, except Faith doth faſten it unto Chriſt, who hath ſanctified all our afflictions by his own ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Thus Faith doth make theſe and all other ſaving graces effectuall and comfortable to us, becauſe it doth bring them home unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou haſt any care of thy ſoul, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it when it is ſad and heavy, to feed it when it is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, to refreſh it when it is thirſty; ruminate well upon theſe things, and if thou haſt any holy deſire to be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the love of this world, and to be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and to injoy the Communion of the holy Ghoſt to direct thee in the way to eternall happineſſe; thou muſt then daily exerciſe and practiſe this holy and Religious duty of zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and devout Meditation in heavenly and ſpirituall things.</p>
